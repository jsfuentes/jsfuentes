Bryan Caplan asks the very important question: what is the value of education, personally and nationally? And he answers with an amazing command and breadth of research, rigorous modeling, and nuanced recognition of uncertainty. And despite this academic rigor, its still very readable. He builds a strong case not just against the current education system, but the fundamental value of education in transforming students into anything besides what they already were. He doesn't shy away from hard questions and looks at all the potential benefits of education from job skills and work ethic to marriage, fertility, values, and crime. I watched three debates about this topic and really think Caplan handily won all of them, the case against education is very strong and shocking.

This author was a fierce egalitarianism that found the genetic science so destabilizing that she wrestled out the nuisance and clarity on this important issue. <br><br>In carefully exploring the topic, this book is also a great intro to understanding genes and social research. She does stick very close to egalitarianism and science and tries a little too hard to resist any ideas countering egalitarianism including racial differences and vast genetic impact. But, this book should convince anyone about the importance of genetic differences by softening the emotional and moral rejection most people have.<br><br>Big Ideas:<br>Two lotteries of birth, natural and social. Both are just luck, not deserved.<br>Even if there are vast genetic differences, how we organize society is a separate political question.

    "review": "One of the biggest secrets of our time is the massive impact genetics and DNA has on personality, intelligence, and outcomes. Despite data accumulating, genetic differences are politically rejected with egalitarianism a foundational idea in the west. This author was a fierce egalitarianism that found the genetic science so destabilizing that she wrestled out the nuisance and clarity on this important issue. In carefully exploring the topic, this book is also a great intro to understanding genes and social research. She does stick very close to egalitarianism and science and tries a little too hard to resist any ideas countering egalitarianism including racial differences and vast genetic impact. But, this book should convince anyone about the importance of genetic differences by softening the emotional and moral rejection most people have.Big Ideas:Two lotteries of birth, natural and social. Both are just luck, not deserved.Even if there are vast genetic differences, how we organize society is a separate political question. We can be antieugenic which means actively countering genetic differences like we do for environment ones. ",

This isn’t the biography of some titan of industry with ungodly work ethics boldly overcoming adversity after extraordinary adversity on a path to fame and fortune. Instead, this is more like those young adult superhero movies.

However, it was pretty scattered covering different topics from philosophy, thinking vs feeling brain, pain, and obviously hope. For each, some useful perspective reduces some aspect of human experience into a very simple idea. So hedonic adaption becomes \"pain is the universal constant\" meaning experience warps so there is a constant level of pain. The book combines many modern ideas and inserts some fine wit too. It would be a great introduction to the general audience. But there wasn't anything too new here. The conclusion of how to live without hope is wanting and almost depressing.

    "review": "Mark Manson is great and I enjoyed all the ideas in this book. However, it was pretty scattered covering different topics from philosophy, thinking vs feeling brain, pain, and obviously hope. For each, some useful perspective reduces some aspect of human experience into a very simple idea. So hedonic adaption becomes \"pain is the universal constant\" meaning experience warps so there is a constant level of pain. The book combines many modern ideas and inserts some fine wit too. It would be a great introduction to the general audience. But there wasn't anything too new here. The conclusion of how to live without hope is wanting and almost depressing. But maybe there isn't a satisfying conclusion to living your life and so the author did the best he could.",

I understood the basic idea that intrinsic(internal) motivation is a better motivator than extrinsic(external) motivation.

The book began somewhat slow simply explaining and pounding that this happiness curve was a thing. The format was usually a backstory of a skeptic scientist stumbling upon this happiness curve and being very convinced it was some essential aspect of the human condition. Though being relatively verbose, this section of the book eventually achieved its goal of convincing me the happiness curve existed across humans with longitudinal studies, cultural studies, and evidence in other apes. Once established, the author and scientists try to explain this curve and provide many many examples of people going through a mid-life crisis. These people are living otherwise great lives but still find themselves unsatisfied. One particularly interesting perspective was the approach of death reorienting how old people live their lives around close relationships and satisfaction. This makes me think this dip in life is not connected to a age like 40, but specifically, middle age where every that comparatively is. Anyway, there are many of these stories and it could be considered repetitive, but I found it interesting and highlighted the authors point that this is a statistical trend not an essential dip for all individuals. In the end, the author concludes with a satisfying point about recognizing the new class of people who undergo career and life shifts in their early old age. I would rate this 4 stars for anyone who is undergoing a middle life/quarter life crisis.

I really wish I had read this book sooner as I asked myself questions like \"How do I know I made the right PM decision?\" or \"When should we release?\" and this book provides good answers. A minor complaint is the book's message is fairly vague serving more as a lens and measuring stick then a rulebook. Though the book is clearly for entrepreneurs, I actually highly recommend it to anyone as I see the lessons are actually general enough to be applied to a wide range of things including one's own life.

Covering everything from the definition of intelligence, dangers of AI, goals of life and the universe, potential future societies, and more. This book's breadth and clear explanations are impressive. The first few chapters might be familiar to those interested in AI, but serve as a great foundation for beginners building to an adventurous 2nd half. Within 8 pages, he walks through the foundation of human motivation; that efficiency is insane. While the book's author enjoys name-dropping and citing his work in the field, the content is carefully selected summarizing some important topics.

Aziz makes light hearted jokes about those little quirks of romance that don't make sense. More humorous than hilarious and data than analysis.

Levistky walks us through how democracies have failed in the past and how they succeed. I have always felt uneasy by this increasing polarization and obstruction in Congress and across the country, but the author drives home the real cost of this, democracy. Specific issues are just a narrow focus of this grander issue. This book convincingly shows the United States is not immune to dictatorship and authoritarian rule. America is showing striking parallels to emerging authoritarian regimes. A love of democracy doesn't prevent its destruction when everyone decides their opponent is a threat to democracy and their existence. With such an opponent, is it really so bad to maybe take away some of their rights? 70% of politically engaged citizens are scared of their opponents. That is a very frightening statistic. This book was absolutely enlightening compelling me to stare at the danger right in front of my eyes.

The inefficiencies of the current education system are very clearly articulated and are kinda appalling once you see it. I am saddened by imagining the kind of person I and all my friends could have been if we didn't spend our lives in a system that stifles creativity and motivation leading everyone in lockstep through some standards. Education is such a huge institution with entire support systems and billion dollar industries built around it that drastic changes are difficult to create, but need to be attempted.

The environment and circumstances play an incredibly huge role in what someone becomes. The author beautifully explores the ideas while citing specific evidence and examples. But, in countering the American idea that people deserve what they have, Gladwell showcases the opposite extreme while avoiding many of the counterarguments. But, I finished the book in a day because it was so in tune with how I believed the world works. On the one hand, it discredits natural genius, skill, and success in favor of hard work and circumstance. This is a powerful view for anyone that can soften boundaries between social classes, motivate people to not limit themselves, and make people thankful for what they have.

    "review": "An amazing book that explores the idea that the truly exceptional were hard working AND extremely lucky products of their circumstances. The environment and circumstances play an incredibly huge role in what someone becomes. The author beautifully explores the ideas while citing specific evidence and examples. But, in countering the American idea that people deserve what they have, Gladwell showcases the opposite extreme while avoiding many of the counterarguments. But, I finished the book in a day because it was so in tune with how I believed the world works. On the one hand, it discredits natural genius, skill, and success in favor of hard work and circumstance. This is a powerful view for anyone that can soften boundaries between social classes, motivate people to not limit themselves, and make people thankful for what they have. Thus, a mandatory book for all.",

Sadly, in the concise size, much of the analysis and explanation is lost and instead just stated with support of perfect examples and denouncement of things that everyone knows to be bad. In diluting the argument to its simplest form, lots of the intricacies are lost and his philosophy is pumped up and hyped as the dream way of living.

It is fairly verbose and explains and derives many ideas through a precise philosophical analysis.

The base of analysis provided really interesting insight into various fields from the analysis of full brain emulation, post-AI society, human society, human intelligence, and human genetic selection.
