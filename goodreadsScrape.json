But it is probably the most comprehensive vision and discussion of AI's impact on education, so still worth the short read. Khan paints a glorious future where Khanmigo is always there to help students, teachers, and parents, redefining the way we do everything from testing to recruiting. I do appreciate his underlying optimism for the future and Khanmigo's team carefully considering potential risks. But he so adamantly asserts teachers will not be replaced that it feels like he is just trying to soothe his future users. In one paragraph, he insists teachers will never be replaced, for they motivate learning with a personal connection. But in another, he praises AI's ability to do mental health coaching, noting we should start talking about AE (Artificial Emotion). It seems like AE can progress to form this personal connection, especially since children anthropomorphize everything already. This seems to me to be the biggest risk with AI in education—replacing children's real social connection and skills for the sake of knowledge in an AI-driven world where the opposite trade makes sense.<br><br>Key Quotes:<br>“This is not a drill, the AI tsunami is here to stay.”<br>“Is Khanmigo a replacement for a teacher?

Bryan Caplan asks the very important question: what is the value of education, personally and nationally? And he answers with an amazing command and breadth of research, rigorous modeling, and nuanced recognition of uncertainty. And despite this academic rigor, its still very readable. He builds a strong case not just against the current education system, but the fundamental value of education in transforming students into anything besides what they already were. He doesn't shy away from hard questions and looks at all the potential benefits of education from job skills and work ethic to marriage, fertility, values, and crime. I watched three debates about this topic and really think Caplan handily won all of them, the case against education is very strong and shocking.

This book has many points I wish everyone knew, but unfortunately, misunderstanding language still causes much unnecessary confusion today. The ideas should be required reading for a more educated population and show how many common, circular arguments especially political are really just confused misunderstandings of language. Perhaps this is the origin of the ideas, but I personally didn't learn much as the ideas are similar to those found in the book/blog series Rationality: From AI to Zombies by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I found Yudkowsky's version more articulate and fleshed out. <br><br>Key idea: Words are a map, not the territory.

    "review": "Old books are a great reminder that our society and ideas are really not that unique and unprecedented. This book has many points I wish everyone knew, but unfortunately, misunderstanding language still causes much unnecessary confusion today. The ideas should be required reading for a more educated population and show how many common, circular arguments especially political are really just confused misunderstandings of language. Perhaps this is the origin of the ideas, but I personally didn't learn much as the ideas are similar to those found in the book/blog series Rationality: From AI to Zombies by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I found Yudkowsky's version more articulate and fleshed out. \n\nKey idea: Words are a map, not the territory. Arguments are often affective and intensional(guided by words alone), meant to stir emotion rather than reflect reality. Rarely is the argument \"will the (extensional) results outweigh the (extensional) hardships involved?\"",

Sowell's book seems like a counter in a debate with derision of the existing leaders and system, but a clearly broken system makes me mad too.

With the underlying story of her own children in early education, the author must not only tussle with the theoretical comparison but decide what is best for her own child. She talks with experts, friends, and students while struggling herself as a parent in Chinese culture. This was engrossing, heartful, as well as critical and educational. For this topic, the book was excellent and highly recommended to anyone interested in education or China.",

The book began somewhat slow simply explaining and pounding that this happiness curve was a thing. The format was usually a backstory of a skeptic scientist stumbling upon this happiness curve and being very convinced it was some essential aspect of the human condition. Though being relatively verbose, this section of the book eventually achieved its goal of convincing me the happiness curve existed across humans with longitudinal studies, cultural studies, and evidence in other apes. Once established, the author and scientists try to explain this curve and provide many many examples of people going through a mid-life crisis. These people are living otherwise great lives but still find themselves unsatisfied. One particularly interesting perspective was the approach of death reorienting how old people live their lives around close relationships and satisfaction. This makes me think this dip in life is not connected to a age like 40, but specifically, middle age where every that comparatively is. Anyway, there are many of these stories and it could be considered repetitive, but I found it interesting and highlighted the authors point that this is a statistical trend not an essential dip for all individuals. In the end, the author concludes with a satisfying point about recognizing the new class of people who undergo career and life shifts in their early old age. I would rate this 4 stars for anyone who is undergoing a middle life/quarter life crisis.

I agree wholeheartedly with the premise: spirituality and meaning are and should be independent of religion and institutions. But, perhaps I didn't read it carefully enough on a sped-up audiobook because I am not sure I am closer to actually attaining that ideal. As a fan of Harris, I really didn't learn anything very new either.<br><br>The book seemed more about proving spirituality and meaning can be independent than being a guide. I'm glad he has started the conversation at least. But, this is more a series of essays tangentially related to spirituality going into science, religion, criticizing specific thinkers, or drugs. <br><br>I'm really not sure who the intended audience of this book is. Is it for people actually seeking spirituality without religion or a lure offering another path for religious people? It is both too abstract and argumentative to accomplish either goal. Sam Harris offers many ideas about spirituality that are probably invaluable once understood and internalized, but I didn't really grasp it. One day, I plan to give this another reading and another chance later.</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"review2502915071\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n    <div class=\"clear\"></div>",

    "review": "I really wanted this book to be better :(. I agree wholeheartedly with the premise: spirituality and meaning are and should be independent of religion and institutions. But, perhaps I didn't read it carefully enough on a sped-up audiobook because I am not sure I am closer to actually attaining that ideal. As a fan of Harris, I really didn't learn anything very new either.\n\nThe book seemed more about proving spirituality and meaning can be independent than being a guide. I'm glad he has started the conversation at least. But, this is more a series of essays tangentially related to spirituality going into science, religion, criticizing specific thinkers, or drugs. \n\nI'm really not sure who the intended audience of this book is. Is it for people actually seeking spirituality without religion or a lure offering another path for religious people? It is both too abstract and argumentative to accomplish either goal. Sam Harris offers many ideas about spirituality that are probably invaluable once understood and internalized, but I didn't really grasp it. One day, I plan to give this another reading and another chance later.",

Levistky walks us through how democracies have failed in the past and how they succeed. I have always felt uneasy by this increasing polarization and obstruction in Congress and across the country, but the author drives home the real cost of this, democracy. Specific issues are just a narrow focus of this grander issue. This book convincingly shows the United States is not immune to dictatorship and authoritarian rule. America is showing striking parallels to emerging authoritarian regimes. A love of democracy doesn't prevent its destruction when everyone decides their opponent is a threat to democracy and their existence. With such an opponent, is it really so bad to maybe take away some of their rights? 70% of politically engaged citizens are scared of their opponents. That is a very frightening statistic.

Despite the narrow focus, the details are respectably researched and definitely well written offering the opposing opinions with all their imperfections and clashing them with the old theories in their most compelling form. All the arguments were clear and never contrived. However, it's clear the science and contradicting evidence is relatively unsettled and thus left up to interpretation. In addition, the book is progressive only against conservative viewpoints and only advanced a little new ground in my eyes.

While sometimes the presentation of Khan Academy as a great solution can be a little overdone, Khan is definitely hoping for change on a grander scale. The inefficiencies of the current education system are very clearly articulated and are kinda appalling once you see it. I am saddened by imagining the kind of person I and all my friends could have been if we didn't spend our lives in a system that stifles creativity and motivation leading everyone in lockstep through some standards. Education is such a huge institution with entire support systems and billion dollar industries built around it that drastic changes are difficult to create, but need to be attempted.

The environment and circumstances play an incredibly huge role in what someone becomes. The author beautifully explores the ideas while citing specific evidence and examples. But, in countering the American idea that people deserve what they have, Gladwell showcases the opposite extreme while avoiding many of the counterarguments. But, I finished the book in a day because it was so in tune with how I believed the world works. On the one hand, it discredits natural genius, skill, and success in favor of hard work and circumstance.

The self-help book has interesting anecdotes and chapters that are short, but convey essential ideas. The ideas weren't very revolutionary to me, as I am already a fan of Mark Manson's work. That being said, the ideas are powerful and are the best I've seen in my life. Sadly, in the concise size, much of the analysis and explanation is lost and instead just stated with support of perfect examples and denouncement of things that everyone knows to be bad. In diluting the argument to its simplest form, lots of the intricacies are lost and his philosophy is pumped up and hyped as the dream way of living.

The base of analysis provided really interesting insight into various fields from the analysis of full brain emulation, post-AI society, human society, human intelligence, and human genetic selection. It provides a rare intense framework of analysis that is somehow easy to follow without boring.

The book is a well-organized exploration of why people misjudge their own future happiness, provides a solution, and then explains why people don't do that. Through the analysis of happiness, you learn some illuminating perspectives and support for the science behind brain analysis and psychology.

    "review": "A very important read that has well-supported analysis and conclusions I haven't seen anywhere before. The book is a well-organized exploration of why people misjudge their own future happiness, provides a solution, and then explains why people don't do that. Through the analysis of happiness, you learn some illuminating perspectives and support for the science behind brain analysis and psychology. The author, a Stanford professor, takes a fairly nuisance search of the issue and offers great anecdotes and studies that compel all his conclusions. Definitely, an essential read for anyone interested in happiness and planning their own life. So basically, this is a book for everyone. ",

Mae, a normal young Midwestern woman, starts a new job at the circle, the world's best tech company with too much power, money, acclaim, and passion to be blocked in any endeavor. The characters are cardboard stand-ins for ideas giving long, eloquently manipulative arguments defining some new intrusive gadget or their share economy way of life. The book's story, however, is lackluster with only minute development approaching unrealistic and trite. That being said, the book really shines through its slyly constructed argumentation giving me some real insight into the spewing of bullshit supporting social media and extreme surveillance in the name of openness. Sadly, the book doesn't really meaningfully engage with the arguments against the dystopian world and left me less convinced of the importance of privacy.

He follows and interviews the participants of various modern social media public shaming and analyzes how their lives were ruined for innocent acts. The internet and public relentlessly berated and destroyed their lives from afar devastating their self-worth. While I kept waiting for some real analysis to begin, the author weaved knowledge in timely sections of his story. Luckily, the stories followed a reasonable progression building up a good understanding of shame. The stories are a lengthy way to explore the elements of shame, but the engaging characters and writing will stick with me as great stories of people who were trashed for doing nothing wrong. I learned some pretty interesting tidbits, scattered throughout the book. When he finally got around to adventurous conclusions, they were particularly well rooted by his stories. But, the end was only slightly satisfying without any real grand conclusions or theories. Overall, good book, I wouldn't really recommend it though just because it is primarily an interesting case studies of people by an author interested in the subject.</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"review2248698040\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n    <div class=\"clear\"></div>",
