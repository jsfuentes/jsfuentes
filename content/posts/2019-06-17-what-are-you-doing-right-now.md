There are a million things you could be doing right now. You could be sprinting down the I­5 screaming at the top of your lungs or on a plane to Paris waiting for the flight attendant to bring out the snacks. But through some arcane internal assessment, you decided reading this particular article right now is what you most want to do.

Are you satisfied with your choice dear reader?

Because this can stop anytime you want. Balancing your long term goals, values, and bodily desires, you decided to click on this particular article willing this reality into existence. But, you could at any moment decide to do something else. Perhaps the thing you should really be doing right now. The thing you have been putting off. Yeah, that one. That seems pretty important. Maybe you should go ahead and do it. You can consider this an offramp for this article.

But maybe you don’t want to do it. You know you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Seriously! There is always an off-ramp and all you have to do is decide to take it. All the reasons you absolutely HAVE to do it are artificial. Running away and ignoring it is a real option.

But as I’m sure you know, there is the future. Actions have consequences. In every single moment, you aren’t just deciding what to do now; you are deciding which road to take. The road can be bumpy ahead but smooth out along a beautiful ocean view. The road can be clear ahead but slam into bummer to bummer traffic.

Now, there countless roads before you. Which one do you take?
