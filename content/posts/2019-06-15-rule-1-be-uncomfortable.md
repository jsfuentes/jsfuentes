We overvalue actions that are easy and comfortable. These short term feelings push us away from decisions that will help us in the long term.

There is a sphere of activities that we are comfortable doing. And everything outside that is uncomfortable. What makes it most uncomfortable is uncertainty. We don’t know what will happen if we have never done it before. So many questions. What if something goes wrong? What if I fail? Can I do it? Will I like it?

But, it is this uncertainty that makes doing it so valuable. You learn something. You can confirm you don’t like doing something. Or you can confirm you can do something. And suddenly there is one more thing added to your sphere of comfort. And you become a much more capable person.
