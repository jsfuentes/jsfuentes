It is the day before graduation and I should be packing or celebrating. But instead, I am going to start creating daily blog posts as my great friend [Dmitri Brereton](https://medium.com/@dkb868) did before me. It's a good idea. Starting is hard. Motivation is fleeting. And now is always the best time to start. So here I am.

Why not just have a private journal?

Well, even if no one reads it, someone could read it. Someone could check. You are right now. Making something public makes me accountable. And this won’t be a journal chronicling my life. This will be a collection of ideas chronicling my mind.

I am worried about the quality and almost didn’t do it out of respect for my 11 followers. But, caring about quality is something you can’t get from a private journal. Worry and social anxiety can actually be a benefit that hopefully pushes me to produce good ideas and good writing.

Any real goal needs some reasons why. Here are mine:

1. Each post is a decision that my ideas are worth sharing

2. Idea generation: Writing generates ideas. Editing creates clarity. Not wanting to be annoying and cliche creates brevity and originality.

3. Improve communication, the great life skill
