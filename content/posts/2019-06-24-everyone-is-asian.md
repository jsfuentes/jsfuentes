“Am I perfect?” I wonder as I gaze into the mirror.

It all began in 1977 in the UK. The first baby was conceived by IVF. It was the first-time humans played god, taking the creation of babies out of the bedroom and into the lab. From then, it was inevitable that the face of the world would change. An extra filter was placed between embryos and life.

“Do you want blue or brown eyes? This one has a better lung capacity, but a greater risk for Parkinson's.” Designer babies became the hot, new accessory for the fabulously rich and wealthy. In our meritocratic society, the elite found a way for money to inject merit into their DNA. The designer babies weren’t just healthier; they were smarter and sexier. Their origin was not advertised and people often wondered how one person could be so lucky. Well, they were designed to be. As these babies grew up and dispersed into the highest ranks of our society, the 90% of people being left behind gave one last cry for help.

Responding to the moral panic, the democratic United States outlawed IVF before the industry completed its evolution. On the other side of the world, China did not care. With the largest population and a ruthlessly authoritarian government, China encouraged it.

Soon, their diligent workforce was technically skilled, tireless, and intelligent — the envy of the world. And they were designed to be. Just like in America, it began among the super-rich. And what parent wouldn’t want their child to be smart, beautiful, and healthy? What parent would choose natural if it meant a worse life? Better embryos required more money as technicians mixed and tested different possibilities. Besides economic, political, and social inferiority, the children of lower classes began to face genetic inferiority as well.

That was until XKN, a 1 in a trillion embryo perfected across every conceivable human trait. She is gorgeous, genius, healthy, artistic, compassionate, athletic, motivated, and mesmerizingly charismatic. She was, by all measures, nearly perfect. The Bs thought effort could overcome XKN’s natural genius. But XKN’s disposition allowed an unmatched focus and work ethic. And best of all, off-the-shelf clones were vastly cheaper than any custom IVF. Soon blood relationships to children became as obsolete as chastity. By 2050, 85% of all births in China were XKN. By 2060, 80% of all births in the world were XKN.

This time, the world leader earned its place not through war, but through economic and cultural dominance. With intense investment in emerging technologies and an increased global presence through measures like the Belt & Road Initiative, China steadily grew its economy and influence until it left all other countries far behind. By the time Americans sang Chinese pop songs in middle school and ambitious students dreamed of a life in China, I knew it was too late. So as the power moved from the US to China, so did I.

In China, the good jobs will only hire XKN candidates. Just one look at me and they knew I was genetically inferior. Luckily, I knew someone who can get me a job. There is however a price.

“Do you like your new face?” she asks.

I put the mirror down and shrug, “It works for everyone else.”
