We have an first world epidemic on our hands: every year millions of cell phones tragically slip through the fingers of their masters and break their screens. Despite prevention efforts through cases and screen protector, countless or more specifically millions of phones each year slip through the cracks and crack. Often times their owners must bear through the hardship of peering through cracks to read Facebook Ads and video essays. I would guarantee that you probably know someone personally affected by this, no one is truly safe. Day after day, all that potential energy from height wastefully turning into the kinetic energy propelling a shattering crack through the screen. Now, imagine if dropping was a positive force instead of a negative one. What if this entire problem of accidentally dropping your phone became a solution. Well, that world is becoming a reality now with the GOPHONE. The GOPHONE uses the latest kinetic absorbing technology to actually charge the phone through falls. Gravity used to just be the misunderstood kid in the corner, but now the GOPHONE turns it into an old friend. But the GOPHONE doesn’t even stop there. It turns all your old problems into solutions. Accidentally pour water into your phone, now the phone gathers that water for internal cooling. Is the phone overheating? Good, now the internal water becomes a steam engine powering your phone through the day. It even solves problems you didn’t know you had! Every wanted to play catch with your friends, but didn't have a ball. Just toss around the GOPHONE and convert your intangible friendships into the much more useful and tangible battery power! Every want to break the theoretical limits of energy conversion? Well to be even remotely viable, the GOPHONE had to do just that. Hallelujah, the world has become a welcoming place because of the GOPHONE.
