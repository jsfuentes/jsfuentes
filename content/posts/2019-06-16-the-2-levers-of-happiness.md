If you want to be happier, then there are two levers you can change.

1. Change the events and environment in your life

Start waking up earlier and establishing good productive habits. Spend more times experiencing everything life has to offer from travel to wine to romance. Create new relationships and deepen existing ones. Learn and work more to earn a better, higher paying job. Achieve wealth and recognition from your peers and field. Spend more time doing the things you like and less time doing the things you hate.

These are all good ideas that might make you happier. But, this is not the only way.

Something happens. You spend Friday night alone in your room watching Netflix or eat cereal for breakfast for the 12th time in a row. And the way this event impacts your happiness depends on how you then interpret the situation. You might sigh to yourself, “Alone? Again? I’m 21 and should be out. Do I not have friends?” Or you might sigh to yourself, “Nice! After a long week, I’m glad I get this time to myself to relax.” One thought leaves you feeling lonely and inadequate and another leaves you feeling relaxed. The only real difference is perception.

2. Change the way you perceive your life

This is not as simple as deciding to be happy. Perception emerges from your worldview, thought patterns, and subconscious reactions. Change is slow and difficult. It requires self-awareness, open mindedness, and deliberate action. But, it can be done.
