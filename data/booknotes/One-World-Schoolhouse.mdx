#Book by [[Salman Khan]]
- “Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind. Therefore do not use compulsion, but let early education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to discover the child's natural bent.” ― [[Plato]]
- Learning to Teach 
    - Old education is one size fits all and passive. 
    - "People learn at different rates. Some people seem to catch on to things in quick bursts of intuition; others grunt and grind their way towards comprehension."
    - Are we just testing test takingability? 
    - Often little change, gap between what we learn and what we need to learn.  Not about test scores,  about potential realization.  
    - Despite failing, students in us will keep advancement because innovation.
    - Critical thinking now survival.  
    - Khan's story
        - Khan with hedge fund.  
        - Works class education, teaches the way I would want to be taught. 
        - Khan blew up, why? 
    - "students should be encouraged, at every stage of the learning process, to adopt an __active__ stance toward their education. They shouldn't just take things in; they should figure things out. This is an extremely valuable habit to inculcate, since in the modern world of work no one tells you what formula to plug in; success lies in the ability to solve problems in novel and creative ways."
    - Too many students know they arent lesrning anything despite good grades. 
    - Underserved in low income and top tier univetsity. 
    - Education must be closer to how humans actually learn and thrive. 
    - Botched test score early can cripple your career. 
    - Teaching is art that is highly personal. 
    - Speak to equal that just doesn't understand yet. Any concept that passes by, if you miss it your doneee. Small class size isnt the one solution. Struggled turoring cousina t fiest but then either answer confidently or say i dont know. Family sent him kids.
- 3-5 min of settling down, 10-18 of attention, then alternate with less attention. 
- Students often remember far more of what they learn in the beginning. 
- 10 minutes is good length for video.  
- Researchers suggest channels to restart focus. 
- People choose to leatn and comcentrate and only happens in yhe mind. 
- Associative learning is connecting new knowledge to something you already know.  
- Links between content severes connections l.
- Students should understand basics before learning more advanced ones.  
    - Believed anyone can learn,  not time based.  
    - Right now time fixed and comprehension is variable. 
    - Mastery is the opposite.  
    - Inertia and money makes it difficult. 
    - Ancedote and statiscal benefit. 
    - But system is averse. Internet changes everything.
- Take personal repaonsibility for your learning. 
- Every student eventially fails to grasp something. 
    - Even if they wanted to go back, they might not have the resources anymore.
-  Ask kids to be natural active and interact. 
- You can sprint ahead if your fast or ask for helo if you need it. Self paced.
-  Blackboard never erased and encoirage to review becuae resoirces to do it. 
- Nurtue wonder
- **Broken Education**
    - Current education is human construct and rather arbitrary. 
        - Entire systems and industries re built around the current education. 
        - Imagine what wee would have to change to change 3 meals a day.  Tv time, lunch hours at work? 
        - Unstandardized tests used to put students into categories. 
        - Before we needed class of Neville docile workers. 
    - How good it's a test, kinda circular. Skeptical plz. 
    - Creativity often underselectd in schools and math and science uncreative.
    - Ideas that college needed for progression started 100 years ago. 
        - Layers started needing post graduate work to pass bar in late 1800$. 
        - Idea everyone needs college to be success decades old. 
        - Technology increases inequity. 
    - Bby 19ty centruy had text books. 
        - Before teaching very never uniform and up to teachers means of inclusion and mitigated bad teachers. 
        - How to deploy teaching told without running uniqueness of teachers.
    - Current system built on creating good citizens not independent thinners. 
        - Period to avoid free thinking by forced change of thought. 
        - Rote meorization over critical anaylsis. 
        - Prodigal model in us. 
    - Committee of 10 lead by Harvard president decide 6-18 model and subjects taught. 
    - Education does good teaching basic skills and social stuff, but we should recognize where it fails.
- **Swiss Cheese Learning**
    - Discrete subjectism. 
    - Done by unit of time instead of mastery. 
    - Can you really build off 75 percent understanding. 
    - Tests test knowledge of particular soonest of knowledge and maybe understanding m
- Frequency of family meals better indicator of school performance than homework. 
- Reverse classroom? 
- $10,499 cost per student we envision more because we can't envision better. 
- Must have enough user of technology m can't just use it to support bad practices. 
- The lecture store and heading and understanding and curriculum must change for iPad to be useful.
- Learning styles was mistake of learning for 30 years.
- Software with knowledge map that recommended concepts to learn next. 
- Have problems and steps of what you did wrong. 
- No swiss cheese learning need 10 correct answers in a row, seeing them up to succeed not fail. 
- Found those who started from the basics often got farther than those who started far saagar cuz they often faced barriers. 
- Students often got extremely stuck.
- Meet some hedge fund manager's wife that have him check for like 100k. Cutting into savings. Bill Gates reached out and give 1.5 million cash. Google have b2 million.
- Adults are better at learning by association. Andgogy focuses attention on learner.
- Curriculum tells a student where to stop. 
- Can a student learn double the courseload. Everyone is a teacher teaching lower children and learning from older. Much like real life.
- Teachers should be like coaches helping you through success and defeat not enemies.
- 1/5 of school day spent on Khan videos, still collaborative. 
- Since society and jobs will change need to give students told to learn because material is less important. 
- If kids can advance at Penn pace, why not? 
- Would it be better for motivation, but wouldn't this free up resources? 
- Sure it would require more attention to each student. 
- "If we let you do, we have to let everyone do it. " 
- Why do students who go to every class still need to cram before the test, cuz so passive.
- MIT students believed you could twice courseload if instead of seat time you did what actually taught you things. 
- Model was just to tell students the minimum of what they have to do. 
- The One World Schoolhouse
    - Mixed age classrooms
        - Sepeartion by age
            - Standardized speed as if every 12 year old is interchangeable and learns at same speed
            - "To state what should be obvious, there is nothing natural about segrating kids by age. That isnt how families work; it isnt what the world looks like; and it runs counter to the way that kids have learned and socialized for most of human history"
            - "Young kids lose heroes and idols and mentors."
            - "Perhaps even more damagingly, older kids are deprived of a chance to be leaders, to exercise reponsiblity, and thereby infantilized"
                - if you can have kids at 12, then you can start taking care of others and hold responsibility. Nature wouldnt have let you. 
        - "I believe that the school of the future should be built around an updated version of the one-room schoolhouse. Kids of different ages should mix. Without the tyranny of the broadcast lecture and the one-size-fits-all current curriculum, there is no reason this can't be done. With self paced learning established as the basic model, there's no reason to lump kids by age, still less to "track" them based on percieved potential. The older or more advanced students become allies of the teacher by mentoring and tutoring the kids who are behind."
        - "No one is just a student; everyone is a teacher as well, worthy of the respect that goes with that."
        - [[Marlboroguh School]], LA all girls prep school, age-mixed classroom is experimented with here. Class was in 6th month at the time of writing, Khan Academy to self learn with all in the same class. 
    - Same teacher/student ratio, 100 students
        - Teaching is lonesome, no peer support in clas
        - "Rather than three or four separate classes of 25 kids and one lonesome teacher, I would suggest a class of 75-100 with three or four teachers."
        - More types of teaching possible with multiple teachers, like debates and different small teams
        - Special expertise and specific personality could create special bond with certain students
        - Decrease burnout by giving "teachers more professional companionship and real time peer support would make their work less stressful" 
        - Constantly be observing and mentoring other teachers
        - Teachers more like coaches as they are on the students side
    - Ordered Chaos, 20% of day spent on lectures rest project based
        - "At a given mooment, perhaps 1/5 of the students would be doing computer based lessons and exercises aimed at a deep and durable grasp of core concepts. Let me pause a moment to stress this: 1/5 of students. This is another way of saying that only 1/5 of the school day, or 1-2 hours, would be spent on the Khan Academy lessons(or some future thereof) and any peer tutoring that it might catalyze. Given the greatly increased efficency of self-paced, mastery-based learning, one or two hours is enough.
        - 20% of students with one teacher circulating and answering questions and difficulties as they occur, p2p help too
        - "I can see(and hear!) a boisterous subgroup learning economics and trying out market simulations by way of board gamees such as those we've used with good effect at our summer camps. I would have another group divided into teams, building robots or designing mobile apps or testing out novel ways for structures to capture sunlight. A quiet corner or room could be devoted to students working on art or creative writing projects A less quiet corner would be reserved for those working on original music. Clearly, it would be an advantage to have a team teacher with a particular affinity for those fields"
    - Vacations are like company vacations, you apply for them
        - Summer vacations are usually wasted and you unlearn during them
        - School building and infra wasted
        - Instead, since self paced learning, students can just take vacation whenever
        - Probably not going away, but could have videos play online and teachers still provide online support i.e lower cost summer school
    - Appraising students, portfolio of creative work and traack progress and work habits
        - Letter grades now. "Could anything be less precise, less meaningful, or more capricious? Easy and hard classes. If they can vary within schools, imagine between schools.
        - "As I said, I am not antitesting; I believe that well-conceived, well-designed, and fairly administered tests coonstitute one of our few real sources of reliable and relatively objective data regarding students' preparedness. But note that I say preparedness, not potential"
        - Eliminate letter grades as in mastery based you ONLY pass with proficiency so an A
        - Instead, "a running multiyear narrative not only of what a student has learned but how she learned it; and a portfolio of students' creative work."
        - track perservance and willingness to help others
    - Levels the playing field around the world
- If they can have children they can be leaders and take care of younger kids.
- Letter grades and GPA give confidence, but at best blunt. 
- Tests measure Preparedness not quality of mind and character. 
- Game of extracurricular and recommendation is played well by rich people especially with their connections. 
- No letter grade just advance with a. 
- Change standardized test often to lessen impact of factories and design component. 
- Portfolio of creative work. 
- Creative problem best representation.
- Better way to help you kids instead of just me mentality is to help all kids. 
- A problem somewhere is a problem everywhere.
- There poorest kids have horrible teachers are they even learning. 
- Possible to give them video lessons with DVD player. 
- Single tablet is cheap is super cheap and can be shared which gives great videos and feedbacks. 
- Provide high quality low cost education to replace private tutors and use revenue to give it to students for free. 
- With micro curriculum can prove you know as much as elite graduates. 
- Instead of just a college degree that is selective. 
- College still great for connections and meeting professors.
