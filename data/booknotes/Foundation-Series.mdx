#Book by [[Issac Asimov]]
The Second Foundation
- “You feel humiliated, my young man, because, thinking you understood so much so well, you suddenly find that many very assistant things were unknown to you. Thinking you were one of the lords of the galaxy; you suddenly find that you stand near to destruction. Naturally, you will resent the ivory tower”
	- fall from grace
- “No matter how the economy and sociology of the neighboring sectors of the Galaxy changed, there was always an elite; and it is always the characteristic of an elite that it possesses leisure as the great reward of its elitehood”
Fountains Edge
- “all you have to do is take a close look at yourself and you will understand everyone else” 
	- “You show me someone who can’t understand people and I’ll show you someone who has built up a false image of themselves”
- “the closer to the truth, the better the lie, and the truth itself, when it can be used, is the best lie”
	- (Should you tell the truth?)
Foundation and Earth
- “You can’t have geniuses and saints without having people far outside the norm, and I don’t see how you can have such things on only one side of the norm."
- "It is easy to argue that a society that depends totally on robots becomes soft and decadent, dwindling and dying out of sheer boredom or, more subtly, by losing the will to live."
- 'A planet might deteriorate even if human beings existed upon it, if the society were itself abnormal and did not understand the importance of preserving the environment.” “Surely,” said Pelorat, “such a society would quickly be destroyed. I don’t think it would be possible for human beings to fail to understand the importance of retaining the very factors that are keeping them alive."'
