#Book by [[Laozi]]
Great summary from goodreads review:
Taoism seeks harmony by freeing the individual from the caustic effects of judgmental thinking, desire, and greed, and its fulcrum is the concept of “non-action,” or literally “doing not-doing.” Non-action, Mitchell writes in his introduction, is not the act of doing nothing but instead is the purest form of action: “The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can’t tell the dancer from the dance.”
“The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem; we can’t tell the dancer from the dance.”


Louza was contemporary of Confucious
