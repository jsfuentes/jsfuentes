title: 'Black Swans'
---

#Book  by [[Nassim Taleb]]
- People once thought all swans are white. Seeing one Black swan can disregard centuries of general principles and ideas. 
- This book is about disproportional impact. 
	- Internet, world war, Islam terrorist have ridiculous effects, but it highly improbable and people act as if it doesn't happen. 
- Biggest impact is what you don't know
- Black swan result from our collective epistemic limitations
	- Black swan is from a perspective
	- Less error pioneer over accuracy
	- Tinkering over planning for good black swan
	- Experts think they know future
	- We score abstract over rules
	- Thinking is hard evolutionary
- Silent hero to prevent disaster is unrecognized
	- Even he feels he does nothing useful
	- Recovery way better
	- Prevention > treatment
	- Treatment reward > prevention reward
	- Platoicity is mistaking map for territory. 
- Big problem is focus on what we understand
	- As science and progress accelerated we will get worse at prediction cuz complications
	- We focus on what we do know and undercount what we don't. 
Chp1 Apprentice of empirical skeptic
- Amazing how easy it is to make a nationalist with a flag and a few speeches
- Great to be compassionate if every once in a while you destroy an enemy
- Generator of events is very different from events
- 3 ailments of history:
	- A) illusion of understanding, world more complex then thought
	- B) retrospective distortion: history seems clear
	- C) overvaluation of facts, handicap of learned people when generalizing
- Exiled people
	- A) who would have thought Christinaitg would be bomb? Super hard to predict
	- B) read someone writing predictions of things that are already happening. Preedited. It's laughable. 
	- C) cab driver and CEOs can equally predict. But, cab drivers don't pretend to know
		- Journalists often cluster around frameworks of analysis and measures of importance
		- Difference of opinion in most subject matters is smaller than difference between opinions and truth
		- Efficient markets say stock price should reflect all avaliable information. 
- Not only are science wrong for ignoring highly improbabke, they create black swans
- This guy is a quantity trading derivatives which depend most on math and decided black swans could be huge
Chp 2 Black Swan
- Random book author success will be studied saying it was obvious. It wasn't. 
Chp 3 Speculator and Prostitute
- Advice: Get job that doesn't scale by hours you work
- Black swan driven, to add zeros
- But, I would recommend nonscalable
	- Because there are dwarfs and Giants and huge players that get most of rewards. 
- Same thing with printing press robbing bards
	- We ascribe a lot of skill and talent after the fact to achievement
	- Like movie that make a star usually mostly luck. 
- Mediocristan has no one matter much
	- Like weight of people
- Extremistan is for social matters like money and book and science
	- Technology produces Extremistan
	- Extremistan allows black swan
- Extremistan and knowledge
	- In Extremistan, knowledge grows slowly and irrerwtically. 
	- There is some chart showing difference between Extremistan and Mediocristan Averagingstan
		- very different focus on different things and predictable different
		- and induction from analysis is pretty useless when one event has huge effect
- Grey swans are Pareto principle and share much with laws of nature so you can learn more about them
	- Don't oversimplify black swans
	- Black swans more consequential and less frequent. 
Chp 4 1001 days
- Turkey is fed everyday
	- Could think it's life is great until Thanksgiving
	- It can predict a lot, but not everything and that is essential
- We predict black swans highly in domains that experienced them
	- Stock market crash makes people expect one
	- More risk managers and study can't gain more from the past then info that is there
- One summer all banks wiped their profits for decades and so practices aren't conservative like they would like you to think
	- Capitalism rewards these year by year risk for multiple year strategies that borrow from fate
- Science can convince people black swans won't happen
- Bad black swans usually very fast with destruction and good ones very long scale like build up of trends.
- Great skeptics doubt dogmatic and wanted to separate medicine from dogmatic science
- Thought you could know effects of event and we're this serene
- Skeptics also make religion more attractive. 
- Wanting to live in Mediocristan
	- We want to cuz we can predict
	- No epistemology needed
	- We don't live there
- 5
	- A) we focus on seen and try to generalize to unseen (confirmation fallacy)
	- B) narrative fallacy, we want storied
	- C) we behave as if it doesn't exist, human nature
	- D) we don't see black swans in history
	- E) we look at the obvious black swans 

Chp 5 confirmation sucks
- No black swans seen vs No black swans possible. Very different
- Hey this serial killer didn't kill anyone when I was with him, prob innocent
- Key to succes is not skill not equal to 'skill is not importnat to success'. 
- We have domain specific knowledge
	- Classroom says all terrorists are Muslim does not equal all Muslims are terrorists. But Muslim walks into a bar and guy gets nervous
		- Didnt transfer
- No evidence of disease different from evidence of no disease. Easy to find confirmation. 
- Confirmation bias easy
- People show you accomplishments and successes
	- If you see someone kill they murderer, not kill don't know
	- A thousand days cany prove you right but one can do you wrong
- Falsification is idea about assymetry of knowledge
	- Differentiates proof and science
	- You know what is wrong more than you know what is right
- Negative empiricism
	- Seek information that would prove you wrong
	- But, we do the opposite confirmation bias
		- 1-2-3 sequence of increasing and people guess
- Grandmasters look for what makes their moves weak
- Don't stroke your own egos
- No real thing as corroborative evidence
- Studies show we generalize in certain domains
- We do tunnel on certain domains looking for black swans.

Chp 6 narrative fallacy
- We like stories and simplification. Distorts us
	- Explanation binds facts and increases impression of understanding
	- Robots would want reduction too
	- Theorizing is the default
		- Must fight against yourself to hold judgement and just see facts
- Conflabulation, are we better at explaining then understanding
- Dopamine decreases skepticism
- Our perception had biological foundation
	- Information is costly to find and store and retrieve
	- Makes sense
	- Black swan is what we leave out. 
- Narrative reduces dimensionality
	- We often remember in this narrative masking this simplified version think the past was simple
		- Desire of order
		- Tend to remember facts that explain casual role, can't ignore posterior info
		- Family of explanations for a set of facts means lack of absurdity doesn't mean truth
- People with careers in randomness feel particular remorse
- You feel less guilty if you write down a narrative like in a journal
- Media wants to provide explanation for any event
	- We wouldn't buy abstract stats
	- Science too is narrative like and meta analysis are better. 
- Floods from California earthquake seem more likely to people then floods
	- No cause given means no cause to us

  

Two black swans, narrated black swan likely to hear about and those that escape perception because they don't seem plausible. If we derive the probs ourselves, we underestimate. If we are given probabilities, we overestimate. People expect terrorist to happen again though it's less likely after 9/11. AAnecdote always more convincing then stats. "One death is a tragedy a million is a statistic" when making decisions remember poster boy over stats. 

  

System one is fast, opaque, intutuon, emotional, heurstics, fast and dirty. System 2 is thinking and effortful, less mistakes, adaptive to mistakes. We often think we are using 2, but nah. 

  

Chapter 7 living in the anitchamber of hope

defect in way we perceive, record, and act on events

Most interesting things are extremistan. Scientists and the like are more likely to fail then medicritocity Stan with steady income.  We believe in longest causality. If you work harder you get better. Could work on science for a year and get nothing. We have to override instinct to prefer immediate gratification and biases. Nonlinear relationships are even too complex to say in a sentence. 

Publishers make more than authors and investors more than founders. Science better than scientists. Scientists paid in hope. Better hedonically on number of instances of positive feelings then size. More small positive affects.

We need others for dignity and respect. No one has achieved anything significant without peer validation but we choose our peers. 

Opposite of black swan for expectation and wanting for really likely event. 

Bet on black swan events if invaluable. Need patience. Loss steadily until you get that huge payoff. Always about how you say things being polite is much easier to control people. 

  

Chp8 Unfailing Luck/do silent witnesses count

Silent evidence in history. Drowned worshipers. Prayers on ships work, if it don't work they die. Bias is systemic error. Silent evidence is what event use to hide their own plausibility. Means in winner take all scenarios when you look around you will mostly see these rare winners. Literature we read is tiny compared to what was written. Great words aren't as unique as we think, imagine all the writers equally good if lucky. People who fail don't write memoirs. Biography seems to assume traits cause success. Gulag doesn't harden people, the hardened survive. You hear about criminal that were caught. Most gamblers had lucky streaks early, beginners luck. We don't see opportunity cost especially for gov spending. Give Help people in visible and sensational way. 

Life saves is stat, hurt is ancedoye by medicine. So even if medicine net helps, but kills a few the risk too much for doctor. People retroactively think their past was less risky then it was. Illusion of stability. Survivor was also a witness and is now biased. 

Not against risk taking but mostly done out of ignorance. Dont compute odds from the winning ggambler, but the cohort. We think it's smarter to say because then fall to randomness. Why did these things happen? Why did this city win the war? We don't withhold judgement. 

  

Chp 9 uncertainty of the nerd

Need thinks within the box. Coin gets 99 heads in a row. Nerd: 50 percent chance next headsm Street smart: 1 percent it's probably a loaded coin. Sure nerd wins Ina. Lab, but Street smart wins in most world's. Military people think of probability very critically. If anything casinos are one of most knowable professions with odds known. Athletes focus on game and completely expected, most vulnerable in real life to a knife say. Ludicrous fallacy, bell curve and knowable uncertainty. Not wild randomness. Biggest losses to casino were unknown, stupid stories like performer mauled or disgruntled employee. Avoid focus when dealing with uncertainty. Prediction not narration is real test.

  

Chp10 we just can't predict

Laser and computer unexpected impactful and happens across most events. Don't let knowledge give you confidence instead of power. We tend to think we know more than we do. If you ask someone to guess a range for some values, people especially MBA students have a very high error rate and have unreasonably tight range, 0- infinity I'd a valid answer. We are often surprised when things done go as planned. 

No difference between predicting from partial information for something someone could know the answer tk or a random event. 

  

Information is bad for knowledge 

Sticky hypothesis. Better to delay judgement because conservation bias. Show a fire hydrants blurry and make it more clear in either 5 or 10 steps. Stop when both blurry at same level. 5 steps with less steps were better because people had more random noise. More info is not always better. 

  

Tragedy of the empty suit

Some profession where you know more than the experts. Vary by profession. Psycho, counseled, analysts, economists, bankers are questionable. Things that move. You could be better at estimating your error rate. Predictions matter more commulative error than how many times you are right. Analysts are more likely to be closer to each other than truth. You point to outliers for why you were wrong and say next time it won't happen m reasoning was right, but game was different one. Almost right defense. Responsible for successes, not for failures those were cuz randomness. Game theorists suck at prediction. Economists mostly work and cite their own domain.  

People systemic underestimate time for planning because of unforeseen events. Those mistakes always make it take longer rarely the other way around. Ignore things outside model. Anchoring, especially for planning. Seeing sales projections anchors our ideas. In life, the longer you live the less life you can expect. But opposite for planning, the longer some project takes the longer you can expect it to take. Scalable randomness. 

Don't cross a river if it is on average for get deep. Accuracy in forecasting very important. Error rate essential and compounding. Should try to narrow range of outcomes. Worst case is essential and extremely important. 

Black swan has 3 properties, unpredictable, constance's, and post explaining. 

Unpredictable. Most impactful discoveries are completely unforeseen. Galielo, Newton, lasers were seen as irrelevant at the time. If you expect to expect something in the future, then you expect it now. Last of iterative knowledge. To know about Discovery of future, you know a lot about the future. We don't know what we don't know. People day stuff like we have discovered all there is to know. 

Some genius the author loves is better thaneinstien. Introduced choas theory by nonlinearoth of forecasts and limits. Three body problem, as third body to tell body system and the accumulated effects can have a huge impact. To calculate 9th impact of bollard ball requires understanding of people s place in the room. Butterfly effect because rounding error to input of weather have completely different world. Grammar is codified roles of what happens naturally. Evidence based theories, if it works we don't have to understand. Tenure in schools solidifies creation of knowledge. Rational actors coherent. Many ways to be irrational. One way to draw a linear line through points. Infinite ways to draw nonlinear lines. This is the riddle of induction: if there isn't one unique way to generalize, then you employee some common sense which is an assumption. We defer judgement to experts even in fields without experts. 

  

Epistomockracy

We don't respect those with a healthy amount of skepticism on what they don't know. Seen as unconfident. Montage, said nothing that is human is foreign to me since I am human. Believed any philosophy must take into account imperfectionions of man. Better being in groups in wrong direction then being alone and right. So leaders aren't skeptical.  We forget how wrong we we're predicting, think of tomorrow like yesterday (linear). Problem of Effective forecasting by Dan Gilbert. Triver idea of self deception says we self decieve to direct us better for the future. Looking into past can be as hard as future. Not super difficult to predict poodle produced by ice cube. But puddle going backwards to shape of ice cube if it even was an ice cube is much more complex. No difference between deterministic chaos and pure randomness. So read history with minimal theorizing. 

  

Chp 13 what do yo do this you can't predict

Philosophy can't just be taught and absorded then acted. Be human with your existential arrogance. Actively disbelief. Rank not by prob but by harm they may cause. Be prepared. World changes through large random errors. Trade-off between voltiality vs risk. Stable ibm job or investment strategy open to huge losses. Be very aggressive and very stable and diversify small bets. Vc aggressive, treasury bonds. Don't do medium risk. No black swan can really hurt ya. Vc, science good black swan. Lending and military got bad black swans. Not lottery tickets, more unpredictable and limitless leverage. Don't predict precise black swan, get prepared in general. Collect opened opportunities. Markets not good predictions of war, sometimes seemingly best suited most exposed to black swans. Ignore analysts. Go for assymetry where good potential outweighs bad. 

  

Part 3 grey swans of extremistan

Bell curve delusion. 

Ch13 Progression towards extremistan. 

Tournament where someone who is marginally better takes whole pot. Luck to. Initial advantage can follow you through life. Most scientists cite papers they didn't read. Necessary to be successful early. Are is so subjective people cluster around what they think is good. Contagious memes must agree with nature. 20 percent of Fortune 500 gone in 40 years. Though more get more, chance will also kill them. Luck is pretty egilitaeian even more than by ability people don't choose. Web creates Google, and tiny markets and moo Google waiting in wings. 

Homogenous failures, fewer but most severe because of banks and global economy. Bell curve statistics all the same means huge potential for all to go down. More robust, but more vulnerable to black swan. One woman one man good for stability. Could retire society roles to combat.

Scoville

Chp 15  Bell curve

At ends, a change in the sigma can throw you off by a trillion because of how fast you degenerate at ends. Guassian looks at average and count soutliers secondary. Can look at outliers as base and other as subordinate. In guassian, everything variations around average and outliers wash out like casinos which don't allow amazingly huge bets so variance small. Standard deviations useless in extremistan. Pure math as made by guassian has no practical value, applied introduces some guesses. Yes, no definite medocritystan like sick or no, extremistan had value like wealth. No real guassian curve just get closer. Meldebronia fractals have scale where you can zoom andzoom out to any size with a simple rule. Medicostan Law of large numbers makes many random things under guassian certainty. Factals should be framework for thinking of random ness. Science is about being right not making predictions. Need way more data to see if something is fractual over guassian. This idea that the scale is very possible of extreme bestsellers or huge market crashes turns someblack swans into grey ones. Black is unknown unknown.

Chp 17

Bell curves in the wrong places. Pretend better to teach a ttheoryeven if it's wrong. Guassian doesn't allow huge variations but extremistan allows long stretches of guassian periods. Harder to disapprove. Some would say you can't throw out guassian just because of black swans, but can't be rectifyed. 

  

The end

You are a black swan, be happy. 

  

Epligoue

Corrections:

Narrative fallacy in history there is changing ideas about it. And some tlof the people presented have had their ifeas/stories changed by more stiyd. History idea now of just focusing on the known.  All major ideas in Economic change if you change some fixed assumption and make it random. Like you learn to specialize, but that can be catroshphic under extreme variance. Large companies become more fragile and optimize away insurance to get eps. The downsides of globalization. Objects like books seem to have auxillary effects over say files you can't show off. 2008 taught nothing and wet learned nothing about blank swans.

  

Similarly in health and fitness greqt to emulate mother nature which we should have a large prior for. Have spurta of feast and famine in both diet and exercise and you can easily handle any stress. This guy just wats a ton or nothing and exercise with walks then crazy sprints. Fasting good for you. 

  

He is advocating what not to do, not what to do. Negative advice is useful. Not saying to predict differently with power laws, don't predict. Not just shit happens, where shit happens. Missing a train doesn't matter if you didn't want to get on the train. Statisticians seem to be embracing the ideas, it's expert trying to apply it to their field. Some say all models are wrong but some are useful. Yes but some are harmful. Many professionals using stats don't understand the basic intuitions on real numbers. 

  

Nerds see more black swans?

Asperbergers are highly adverse to ambiguity lack good empathy and theory of mind. Engineers and sciencists are more like this and male dominated. Extreme past events can't predict future extreme events. Alan Greenspan argued they didn't forsee crash because it never happened before. Distinction without difference is distracting from what is important. 

  

Black swans this stuff is first talk of limitw of knowledge. Can make safer society by knowing limits of knowledge and risks. Truth not usuable in practice. The rarwr the event the bigger error with less info. If we need data to obtain prob distribution and we also need prob distribution to guage data is sufficient to predict future you have a problem. If large rare events have huge error rates prediction is very difficult.

Anchoring shows bad predictions are bad. Friedman pushes this book to be more about where prediction is wrong rather than prediction is wrong. Medicine harmed people sometimes. If cant get good barbeel position(really stable and extreme), heere advice. Respect time. 

  

Mitigate fourth quadrant, insurance to get a barbell. 

1.  Have respect for time, high prior for things that have worked for a long time. Status quo bias
    
2.  Avoid optimization, love redunancy. Avoid speciation
    
3.  Avoid prediction of small probability payoffs
    
4.  Avoid predicitablitly of remote events. Stress tests ha
    
5.  Beware bonus payments moral hazard
    
6.  Avoid risk metrics based on medicriosta, linear regression
    
7.  Positive and negative black swan
    
8.  Don't confuse absence of violaoty with absence of risk
    
9.  Beware risk numbers
    

10 principles for black swan robust society

1.  What is fragile should break early while small.
    
2.  No socialization of losses, what isn't should be small
    
3.  If you crash your bus, don't give them a new bus. Irresponsible to give control back to big banks and gov 
    
4.  Don't let someone with an incentive bonus manage risky things. Hard to see risks. Needs punishments not just rewards
    
5.  Mirror complexity with simplicity in financial products. 
    
6.  Don't give kids dynamite sticks with a warning label. Don't have complex financial products people don't understand. 
    
7.  Don't have gov restore confidence. Only need confidence in ponzi scheme
    
8.  Don't give addict more drugs to cure pains. No leverage make up
    
9.  Don't use markets as warehouses of values.
    
10.  Make omelet with broken eggs, rebuild system because of 2008. World where entreprenuers take risks not bsnkers
