# Notes
- author wants to tell real AI story based on tech that is 80% likely to happen
	- “I believe this book represents a responsible and likely set of scenarios”
	- Doesn’t guess about breakthroughs
- harri “sci-fi is most important artistic genre of our time”
- stories try to use historical events to figure out how people react and try to strike empathy in us
## 1 The golden elephant
- summary
	- Mumbai deep learning insurance through series of app, but teenager girl finds it hurts her pursuit of love
		- Risks of too much data, and over optimization
- parents can make kids data decisions, “women control data sharing in more than 60% of households”
- data literacy class, virtual classroom,  and prompts on sharing data, but appealing deals and insurance discounts if you don’t
- offers to be prettier for boy he likes, 
- Change in behavior change premium
	- Sweets for younger brother increases premiums
- when she wanted to stalk the boy or invite him out, the app distracted her with popup or crashed
	- Parents yell at her for raising premium
		- she runs and asks him out and parents track her easily
- parents allow her cuz of book recommended
- Boy can’t enter restaurant cuz would increase premium
- “ai only learns what humans teach it”
- “Ai identifies the invisible discrimination in our society and quantifies it”
- analysis
	- every click causes supercomputer to be pointed at getting the attention of your brain
	- could make sure objective function is always good instead of just optimizing revenue
		- Could make sure companies interest aligned with consumers
	- AI can figure out protected classes indirectly
## 2 Gods behind the masks
- summary
	- Person commissioned to make undetectable deep fake video
- everyone wears masks in Nigeria to avoid tracking 
- vampire boy went viral, but was taken down and demonetized
- boy that struggles for work, blackmailed by gay video that could send him to prison/extorted by corrupt police
- boy would make video filter that made him look and sound like a girl 
	- compulsive deepfake detector in all platforms 
- Nigerian dead politician deep fake becomes popular commentary but no one knows whose behind it
	- Guy decides to discredit by making video of it taking off mask to be controversial politician
	- Politicians have special AI model detecting fakes cuz their important, but possible with enough compute 
- analysis
	- Could have blockchain for photos, but would need to be on devices
	- visual hacking to make tank hospital or Tesla drive to oncoming traffic is hard to debug in AI models
## 3 Twin sparrows
- smart ai teachers disguised as cartoon friend
- Story
	- orphans of twin sparrows, parents died when someone turned off self driving 
		- Silver sparrow and gold sparrow, silver had aspebetgers 
	- V mirror interface would be for these kids age 4 and they choose the voice and shape, Vpal 
	- ai has repore and trust with student, always appears to help so student wants to help back
	- silver sparrow produced art with his AR, evolving images that win competition
		- Great creative functioning but not interpersonal skills at 6
		- Hacks his brothers ai cuz Golden hacked his art
	- golden sparrow says only his AI buddy understands, not the parents 
	- golden sparrow adopted by kids who wanted the best for their kids from travel to education, only the best deserve the best
	- Silver sparrow parents about less focus on technology, ai had put less on competition 
	- Eva a girl classmate would always say what he needed to hear, can you show me how to do that or wow it’s a hard one and do tricks
		- then Eva changed when parents want to push him, as he seemed too happy being #1
		- then she was rougher and turns out she’s AI
	- silver sparrow could see how virtual classroom was trying to teach him and classmates pretending to motivate him 
		- But ai friend was good and a great ai tool to create art
		- omnidirectional VR 
	- golden trying to be better investor, but Ai creates better then 80% analysts and destroys him
		- Golden try’s to differentiate by talking to people 
		- “Have you ever thought that maybe your belief system isn’t that well studied to you”
		- “Son when you can’t change the world you have to change yourself”
	- AI buddies programmed to keep the brother together through some weird insight and they decide to combine their ais
- analysis
	- 20 years children will definitely get close to AI cuz so easy for them to anteophroize 
	- used to need special purpose labeling for specific use cases like travel, now transformers and gpt3 just stare at normal text 
	- 24/7 access and customized message, author thinks her is very unlikely and just remember it’s a model and not the cute one
	- **author doesn’t think deep learning will be AGI or singularity by happen by 2041**
		- we haven’t figured out how to model creative, strategic thinking, counterfactual, and these will require a dozen more breakthroughs but we have only had one great breakthrough in 60 years
		- AGI is narcisstic seeing us as gold standard when there can be huge changes without it
	- class today still resembles 10 years ago with lectures, examination, test, and turoting
		- these can all be done by AI 
		- Virtual teacher can be for each student 
	- lower costs and accessibility 
## 4 contact less love
- summary: Covid-19 continues and so new household robots, and changing conventional medicine. Heroine closer herself off too much
- story
	- Covid became seasonal and changed peoples life style, no handshake
	- ai algs colored risk of outbreaks by location taking patients etc 
	- had boyfriend from Brazil for 2 years that she had never met in person, she a Chinese planned to live alone forever after 3 years
	- virtual music festivals
	- 1M distance from people, transparent face shield, and mist on hands
	- She once worked for gaming startup inperson until superspreader event
	- started making love virtually, now he wanted in person but she said she wasn’t ready
		- he said you will never be ready, his last message
	- she had some tech that would monitor distance from infected, needed membrane but you need to go outside to get it
	- turns out he was taking a red eye to see her and got a bad case of Covid 
		- it was new mutation so a new medicine was being ai modeled for him
	- she decided to break her 3 year isolation to see him
		- She didn’t have vaccine record cuz isolated so couldn’t take taxi and many services
	- man/taxi just happened to see her and help her cuz looked sad or something
			- Crime against public safety
			- once worked at tech startup that created  biosensor membrane 
	-  everyone now needed membrane and marginalized people's outcast
	- man helped her put on fake air band that wouldn’t trick computer but would people
	- Garcia dying but mumbling about her
	- broke into hospital, distracted robots with lights
	- Turns out Garcia planned everything like a level designer and had the taxi driver pick her up, faked video and audio
	- I love you made it better
- Analysis of healthcare
	- **healthcare will be industry most transformed** by ai
	- existing records digitized, tele radiology
	- ai can help you figure out when to apply drug with full info and studies
	- rapid genome sequencing, drug discovery ai
	- ibm Watson diagnostic used data for human consumption like notes, but ai should do large patient data and start small
	- drug discovery, find molecule to inhibit virus
		- use mRNA to get protein sequence, easy
		- Find 3D structure with protein folding
		- Identify target on 3D structure
		- Find treatment molecules and select best
	- 2-4 all take time and have 90% chance of failing real trials
	- mRNA vaccine New approach that look at mRNA and protein structure then when inject in body cells synthesize it so immune systems stops it 
	- Alpha fold 2 best contribution by ai to healthcare
	- drug repurposing trying all existing drugs on new structure to avoid trials
	- **Daignostic ai will be better then the best doctors in 20 years** and all surgeries will have robotics
	- precision medicine is about  individualized treatment
		- doctors will become caregivers, 
		- Smart data will collect data to preventively diagnosis
		- will allow you to donate date and body when you die
		- ai will help us live longer with nutrition, therapy, and better life. Potential 20 years increase
	- robotics will take longer but possible
		- in-house cooking and cleaning, transportation, reception, etc
	- Increase productivity and flexibility with remote
		- meeting notes and avatars , virtual customer support and teachers with lots of info about customer
	- automation happens with confluence of economic difficulty and new tech
## 5 my haunting idol
- future of entertainment where games immersive and blurred boundaries, VR
- Story
	- Tokyo seance, medium women speaks in man’s voice and the idol is like I am cold and want to sing my song
	- Farewell concert, idol said her name and invited her up. Just a dream
	- ghost of Hitoshi, henceforth called hiro, appears in her house
	- fan officer job was being super fan to dumb support, could instant pass for die hard fan for anyone
	- Man girl had depression, felt like extra in life, unsuccessful suicide attempt, idol song lifted her
		- Made her not feel lonely
	- all material of idol given to tech company
		- girl hand picked for project 
		- hiro gave off boy next door vibes
		- ico trying to figure out who killed hiro
	- he had an agent that was disappointed he decided to retire
		- She calls her agent to ask questions
			- Agent asks her what type of fan she is, treat him as god or human/friend 
	- hiro assigned death was drowning, but didn’t have water in lungs or bleed out of ears by water pressure
		- She typed in answer box and got autopsy report for poison 
			- One of two medications who killed was angelic, a antidepressant
			- prob taken orally cuz happened during intermission so needed to control time
	- she watched tapes and used intimate fan knowledge
	- could only ask hiro ghost 3 questions, now on last
	- Asks why hiro is on antidepressants
		- good question, said after announcing retirement fans hated him because they relied on him and suicide was way for those people to let him go
	- she got to watch his death now in VR, took drug before he entered changing room that was on guitar pick
	- Cheering for her for being best found detective and hiro thanked her
	- Winner gets to choose reward
		- ai doll that just like him for one month
		- meet real hiro for tea
	- Met hiro for tea, mid 40s now two decades older then when he retired
		- ask for feedback on the game
			- She suspended disbelief, 
			- She answered a ton of questions before, and ai did most, but human writer stepped into help, hiro did it
		- what really happened?
			- hiro decided he hated his persona, and tried to come out as himself and sponsors and fans started hating him
			- he got depressed and then started vyber, the company behind the fans
	- idol need to have group around it, Social can’t create one
		- hiro would be first idol and take a decade in nlp and model to let people create the story and real time conversations
	- girl gets job there after meeting him
- Analysis
	- XR is in reality and seamless integration
	- XR is group of all VR, AR, MR is mixed reality beyond AR so not just overlay
	- XR contact lenses, 2041 author predicts ai will be able to understand scenes and create realistic senses
	- google glass and speakers aren’t good enough and HoloLens too big and so dorky
	- XR Apple product by 2025(vision pro)
	- contact lenses will be when it becomes widespread and companies already working on this
	- haptic suits, could simulate hit by causing muscle contraction
		- Scent, taste, and more simulators being developed
	- move on Omni directional treadmill odt, can rotate on user so they are centered and can be filled to simulate hills 
	- training, surgery, shipping sample, entertainment and games
		- Microsoft sold 22B HoloLens for military training, 
	- Problem is content, content in 3D very hard to make but no reason to if no one is using it, chicken egg investment required
	- Naked eye MR unlikely to be as good, worked at concert for artist seen from far away
	- neuralink is crazy vision but very far away and prob won’t achieve human application ambitions
	- to pick convenient time to appear in story ie not the shower, app would have to watch her at all times
##  6 the holy driver
- shur lanku, self driving replacing AI
- story
	- haptic suit cuz got a gamer, pay to Buddha
	- uncle lost job as driver, only perfect record drivers
	- Friend of uncle needs kids like him for future of self driving
	- “The most important thing about driving is not the car but the road”
		- Shur lanki roads rough and safety dynamic
	- Jamal was best player at vr cafe, driver and was in middle school
	- simulation company, put in cockpit
		- In his exact car in front of his house virtually, but could only go straight and no walkers cuz low difficulty
		- More reactive but same as games
	- company needs more good drivers or investors will lose faith
	- Jamal top of training list
		- One scenario tsunami and drivers jump between 100 different cars to get them to safety and save passengers
			- Make him exhausted for days
			- found tsunami in Japan on news that looked just like game layout but different location/visuals
	- meets designer, who implies it’s mix of real and fame
	- goes to China and sees world with L5 driving, connected networks and smart sensors across roads
		- cars move in formations
	- Human drivers have difficult exam and need AI assistants along with human only roads
	- Jamal’s job is to take over when roads and system changes
	- pretend it’s a game to increase performance, 
	- uncle was driver 10 years ago due to injury
		- Boulder hit car with medical supplies and he pushed haptic feedback to max and his leg stayed injured in mix of fact and fiction 
	- leap shock, people lose their jobs but more jobs will be created
	- Terrorist attack on holiday had SUV to rescue people, Jamal volunteered even though he had just wanted to quit
		- Last batch terrorist with bomb jumped on it, he went off mission to save passengers
- analysis
	- av holy grail for tasks, so author thinks will take until AI 2041 as part of smart city infra 
	- 0-5
		- 0 no automation
		- 1 one task like steering of human turns it on
		- 2 multiple tasks like steering and braking and acceleration but supervise
		- 3 eyes off, can alert when need to take over
		- 4 mind off, ai take over for specific routes
		- 5 no steering wheel, no need for humans on any road
	- 3 available now
	- 5 needs crazy amount of info so variable
	- 6G can bring data needed for story using human drivers in terrorist attacked and natural disasters
	- fixed route bus starting now
	- Implications
		- Lower cost and higher safety, better utilization
		- cars can share info in network, 2 inch margin, pay for right of  way, 
		- Massive car maintence, parking, drivers all be replaced/disputed
		- Ethics, liability issues
			- trolley problem
			- What if ai made decision, in legal system you explain decision but ai explanation hard 
			- is having ai just better than humans good enough
			- Who is to blame? Important to answer so existent can develop, credit cards responsible for fraud not credit company so they charge fees creating markets
##  7 Quantum Genocide
- computer programmer uses quantum computing and autonomous weapons for evil after climate disaster
- Story
	- Hacker near massive data center in Scandinavia 
	- hackers group some blackmailed about digging for internet treasures like satoshis wallet
	- Someone used absurd qbits to hack the wallet that had more then some sovereign nations 150B
	- drill to stop hostages with hacking eyes and emps , smart bullets
	- grieving physicist on the edge of quantum has his family die
	- drones attack key oil pipeline and port, happened at 7 major ports
		- skyrocketing prices, supply issues, local routing, into war exx x petted 
	- Robin called in by gov to investigate drone attack
	- Physicist interrogated threatened with bad trip a helmet that makes you relive horrible things and reads your emotions
		- He gives next attack location but still given helmet
	- chase swarm and Robin uses some hack thing to send message
		- Swarm goes to hotel and Robin tames one
		- drones kill ray Singh and stop
	- Mark physicists relieved worst memory, mother and child die in wildfire caused by global warming in California winter
		- Mark started hating human arrogance and greed, stayed up and used dark web 
	- Robin find someone on web group that likes plutonium and mimicking human from dead data
	- Robin lied for “a conviction that in this terrible world one should not be deprived of hope even if it is misguided”
	- Mark blames pge and climate change
	- mark sees a recreation of his dead wife and child who ask him what happens next
		- He says when everyone in list is killed next phase starts
		- Mark killed himself with a tooth neurotoxin 
	- Robin thought next phase was radioactive bombs in space flights So stopped flights, prob didn’t get enough material to do on ground
	- targeted dns people towards internet security with padded killed list
		- simulated nuclear could destruct power grid with emps
		- 100s of people would die and industries would sue along with most travel
	- decided to target rockets with lasers, 
	- Web connecting works collapsed and rain of fire falls
	- no electricity or internet and no one knew how to turn it on
- analysis
	- quantum computing will work 80% chances by 2041 by authorestimation, 4000 qbit
		- Cracking Bitcoin encryption first lucrative application
			- Quantum 1994 paper that breaks RSA which Bitcoin users, asymmetric crypto 
	- autonomous weapons
	- quantum computing
		- qbits with superposition can calculate multiple uncertainty at same time, exponential reduction of complexity
		- entanglement means actions performed on one affect another, doubling quantum computing only requires adding one qbit 
		- Extremely sensitive to environment
		- 2 in 1998 to 68 in 2020
		- Some things million times faster, 64 qbit can solve something that would take normal computers years
		- Programmed completely differently
		- would be great for drug discovery
			- Better modeling world
		- 2010 shift to not showing public key in ledger transactions p2ph, but many in old format like satoshi wallet
			- Qbit can find private key given public key
		- Quantum resistant algorithms exist using qbit and very expensive computationally
	- Autonomous weapons
		- gunpowder, nuclear arms, and third big invention is autonomous weapons
		- Current Israeli drone that finds and kills targets
		- Could be built for less 1k, like killer drone that target Madurai in Venezuela 
		- Swarm of drones that could wipe a city could cost less than 10 million
		- case for
			- Save soldiers lives, Target only combatants and bad people
		- Case against
			- Lower cost to killer with little accountability
			- Enable genocide and lower cost of war
			- no detterant like nuclear
		- Can either have human in the loop or ban, but main advantage of autonomous is quick ability to make decision so human in loop bad incentive
##  8: the job savior
- fture AI replacement jobs creates need for human talent reallocation
- story
	- 2020 started AI replacement causing large scale layoffs
	- 2024 UBI
		- VR games, drugs, porn. High suicide rate some called repeal of UBI and 2028 huge issue
	- 2032 UBI abolished, instead new job reallocator, occupation restoration that would retrain people and required to be used in any layoffs
	- job reallocators
		- track economics and skill demand, skills and personality tests into customized plans
		- Occupational restoration specialist give people jobs and dignity
	- “history has shown that policies like UBI only pro longed despair. They can’t solve the fundamental problem. That people without the sense of achievement they gain from substantive work feel lost and hopeless”
	- synthesia big company she works for and they really want massive construction contract for big layoffs at landmark
	- she went to protest as reporter  heard about omega alliance offering 100% reassignment success
		- Most reallocation give shitty jobs and make you move 
		- Her company only offers 28% 
	- ceo meets old friend in same business
		- 99.73% conversion and offers him a job/buy his company
	- women upset she got reallocated twice as AI creeps, “How much time do I have this time?”
		- “Do we really help people or are we accomplices” 
		- “Everyday I lie to the unemployed, tell them not to give up hope”
	- football on decline because of safety concerns, but digital bars still packed
	- managers not safe from ai
	- omega gives people new job in VR with computers after simple training
	- assistant girl father went from credit analyst to customer facing underwriting to unemployed, quantitative job vanished first
		- many became social worker or nurse aid cuz human touch
		- Father was introvert, went from optimistic to unemployed became cynical and drank
	- new job trial for union workers with omega
		- vr Google and gloves, following onscreen instructions to make water greater for 1000 soft residence
			- human computer hybrid
			- use construction skill to control robots globally for high end clients, bright colors like game that give more rewards if you do well
		- Maybe it’s just a game
	- Turns out it’s just a Sim game cuz plans not in real world
		- Woman says value of work is stability, this is a one and done solution
			- Who wants the blue pill
		- Boss says her end game is just UBI, but what if virtual work can produce real value
	- One year later, both omega and synthesia joint took contact in new way to reallocate
	- Jennifer assistant has robotic interaction with former bartender, is she a spy
		- They starting to make automate reallocation calls
		- turns out new virtual workflows just added some work would be fake
			- **screen for human talent and entry level roles are increasingly about gaining skills not doing real work**
- analysis
	- work replacement could cause social unrest and mental problems
	- Jobs most at risk are routine and entry level
	- “When it comes to work is ai ultimately a blessing or curse?”
		- Could real work be so rare that out mostly became virtual to pass time
	- 2041 construction workers became prefabricated component
		- 40% of current jobs replaced by 2033 
		- rpa watch workers then automate work
		- Ai could do digital screening, performance evaluation, onboarding and more
	- some say New jobs, but ai changes all industries at once
		- wages will drop as increasing number of unemployed people compete, and capital applicators get massive wealth
	- work ethic out of Industrial Revolution puts work at center, will cause suicide
		- for example taxi driver already had higher suicide
	- UBI, author thinks ubi should give people job retraining
	- what can ai not do? (lol not true)
		- Creativity, conceptualizer our plan strategically, across domains of common sense
		- Empathy, can’t make someone feel understood or cared for
		- dexterity, precise hands true coordination in novel spaces
	- creative but asocial will be accelerated, creative and social like high level executives will shine
	- three rs: relearn, recalibrate, and renaissance 
		- Relearn
			- People in endangered job should be warned and encouraged to retrain 
			- Service jobs like nursing will increase as life gets longer
			- roles like volunteers youth group, caring for family, etc might became paid jobs
		- Recalibrate
			- Reinvent many jobs as ai does routine tasks
			- Doctor became caregiving as ai does diagnostics
		- Renaissance 
			- Reorientation towards human expression, creativity, and connection
			- “I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study math and philosophy, my sons ought to study these and natural history, commerce, and agriculture that their sons have right to study painting, poetry etc” John Adam’s
	- new socioeconomic institutions
	- “we are the generation that will inherit the unprecedented wealth from ai, so we must also bear the responsibility of rewriting the social contract and reorienting our economies to support human flourishing “
## 9 isle of happiness
- enlightened monarch wants to make people happy
- story

	- 6 guests were celebrities: cryptographer, poet, film star, neurobiologist, mountaineer
	- Invited by crown prime and greeted by his sister
		- invited cuz they all have different ideas about happiness and are all unhappy
		- can’t do early exit, fee is matched to total net worth cuz no one read contract
		- leave when island decides you’ve found happiness
	- brother watching but thinks his presence will change results
	- middleware government combined open source, federated learning, and distributed computing
		- Great service, Wall paper for his mood, waiters recommended great dishes, trails guide in different views, show info before he knows he wants it
	- Real time translation hanging in air, Play off 1001 nights, 
		- man squandered his rich inheritance and then goes to work for someone who asks him never to ask why they cry, He works for years and eventually old man warns him not to be allocated by truth but if he wants it beyond that door

			- ai predicts viktor has more than 80% off suicide in next two years
			- hope is to make people feel challenge and meaning
	- encryption Artist breaks his robot, and him and guests demand they are freed
		- island works with smart contacts, no control
		- uav swarms shock everyone
	- Viktor stayed on island and he had new annoyances like seeing news stories of his company, mud, buggy robot
		- AI would bring prices and victor together
		- He found himself find a bit of happiness talking to her about how to make it better

		- try’s to walk though night before desert kills him until exhaustion
	- uav saves him, sister saves him, all part of game
		- all guests were also robots 
		- He was chosen cause game Empire can help
		- Man laughed and cried
- Analysis
	- can ai optimize happiness?
		- Unclear
		- 4 reasons difficult
			- What’s happiness
			- Measurement
			- data, v personal
			- safe storage, trust must be interest aligned 
	- What is happiness?
		- Maslow hierarchy of needs
			- wealth is only lower level
			- Eudamonic happiness only after hedonic
	- measurement, three ways
		- ask people, not continuous
		- iot devices to capture behavior, voice, micro expressions for emotional data
		- measure hormones in blood
	- data, decentralized vs centralized
		- Gdpr hoping to give people data control back
			- barrier to ai as requires content for use
				- requires enumeration of use of data
			- can be counter productive for applications 
	- who can be trusted with all our data
		- When interest of ai owner vs ai users, users lose as companies optimize profits
		- Enlightened monarchs were key to enlightenment believing they were met to improve life, so story issues that as starting point
		- Nonprofit ai
		- privacy computing
			- Federated learning, homomorphic encryption that doesn’t allow ai owners to see data
			- Trusted execution environment decrypts data on chp for ai trading so data can’t leave
## 10 dreaming of plenitude
- huge abundance so money might lose value in post scarcity
- 2 currencies: one for Basic needs, and one for providing community value
- story
	- ai village designed by ai with personalized suggestions
	- girl assigned to take care of ms Campbell
		- Smart wristband to teach her progress
		- Community medical director at medical service said all her other caretakers quit
			- Paid in mula not cash
	- Campbell noticed by ai she was approaching Alzheimer’s and ordered companion to slow disease
	- Aging population and high unemployment, at 12% employment
		- Hit young aboriginal most
	- batteries and energy and precision medicine, comprehensive medical and welfare care put Australia at zero emissions and haven for retiring with 87 life expectancy
		- young rebelled causing new policy that have UBI to young s as well created mula that rewards community and helping increase wellbeing
	- Higher mula could be used for credit checks and social status, replacement of wealth
	- mulga dependent on impact on others
		- Aboriginal did worse, 
	- Kira, girl assigned to help also helped other members of sunshine village and they clicked button giving her mula
	- gene therapy for Alzheimer’s existed but was huge waitlist
