## prejudices of philosophers
-   Why don’t we seek untruth or ignorance?  
-   Philosophers seem to think there is some divine origin of it highest values
-   "Fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in antithesis of values "
	-   "It might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and respected things consists precisely in their being insidiously related knotted and crocheted to those evil and distantly opposed things-perhaps even being essentially identical with them " ^b66945
		-   New philosophers needed to ask these questions
	-   Greater part of conscious thinking of philosophers is instinctual
		-   For example, certain more valuable than uncertain and truth over illusion are natural but perhaps superficial valuations needed for or mode of life

On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither—but what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus "makes a sacrifice"—it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the contrary!—will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems."
			- **But if you have drifting into it, let us set our teeth firmly, open our eyes and keep our hands fast on the helm. We will crush our own morality, but what do we matter.

		- Which means in morality, instinct, faith, or the herd has triumphed over reason
	- Descartes is an exception as the father of rationalism "recognizing only the authority of reason but reason is only a tool and Descartes was superficial”
- The oldest and most common  in knowledge and cognizance is the premature hypothesis, the fictions, stupid will to belief
	- Our senses never fully develop to be reliable. We find it easier to pattern match some image or word to some past experience then see something new
	- Our sense are hostile to new and so even in simple sensations emotions dominate
	- We fabricate much of even our most remarkable experiences    
	- We have been accustomed to lying, one is very much an artist
		- **Our understanding of the world far exceeds the strength of our senses**, like seeing someone’s face and their emotions
		- Our dreams belong to our soul just as much as actual experiences
			- Dreaming of flying and its happiness would change how you perceive and long for happiness in real life
- Differences of men isn’t only in their ranked list of what is desirable, but much more in what they regard as actually having and possessing a desirable thing "  
	- **For example a woman (Levels of love)**
		- One man would see sexual gratification and owning her body as ownership  
		- Another see just this as questionable and wants her to give up something for him
		- Another asks when she gives something up for him is it just for a phantom of him and this wishes to be know deeply
			- When she loves his devilry and concealed insatiably as much as his goodness and patience
	- Helpful people subtly set people up so they merit help, seek just their help, and are grateful and subservient for the help
		- Jealous when forestalled in their charity
		- Father and mother see child as possession
		- Every teacher, priest and princes sees in everyone an opportunity for a new possession
- Jews born into slavery inverted value system
	- fusing ideas of rich goodness wicked violent and sensual 
	- Fused ideas of Poor Saint friend
- **All moral systems about happiness are suggestions for behavior adapted to their environment**, recipes for passions with mix of old wife wisdom
	- All problematic because they generalize themselves to all when it’s not 
	- Expediency mixed with stupidity
	- Indifference and coldness towards emotional folly like stoic
	- No more laughing or wiping off Spinoza, destruction of emotion through analysis
	- Aristotle enjoyment of emotion in art or live of god
	- Or bold surrender to emotions of Haifa and Goethe especially for wise old Men for who it isn’ta dangers
- Humans have always gathered in herds which have a few command and the rest follow  
	- it’s innate to need to follow some unconditinal command to do something and we seize and accept anything shouted in our ears by our commanders of parents laws public
	- The problem of all this hesitation and retrogression is obedience is counter to the art of command
		- if we become too obedient there will be no leaders or they will suffer from a bad conscience and will have to deceive themselves to command as if they were actually obeying
			- This problem is current in Europe, moral hypocrisy of the commanding class where they pretend to obey some higher order (constitution, justice, god, or instruments of the people)
	- European gregarious man glorifies his virtues of kindness, deference, industry, modesty, indulgence, sympathy where he is useful to the herd”
		- Constant attempts to replace commanders with summing together many of these men in constitutional representatives
			- But people love throwing off their responsibility to someone like Napoleon
- In an age of dissolution with mixed races and contrary standards of value creates weak men
	- The weak man wants the war within him to end and happiness appears as a soothing mode of thought like epicurean or Christianity
	- But conflict can be additional incentive to life
		- if you have irreconcilable instincts and mastery/self control/self depiction for continuing conflict then you become predestined to conve conquer others like Caesar 
	- both these types of men appear at same time because of same cause
- if maintenance of community determines morality then you can not have morality of loving your neighbor
- A society with those honorable instincts called virtue that almost coincide with morality are ultra moral not moral
- Gregarious morality of mediocrity and fear "herding animal morality" becomes popular in peaceful times like in Europe right now and ideas that elevate individual considered bad
	- "Certain strong and dangerous instincts such as love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power... cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies)" were branded under nicer names but are now seen as dangerous and branded immoral
	- Loftiest and strongest instincts that elevate the individual above the herd breaks community so defamed while tolerant mediocrity, sheep, becomes honor
	- notice it's the men with modern ideas that is the herd 
	- "Democratic movement is the inheritance of Christian movement"
	- socialist hate all but the herd and belief in morality of mutual sympathy 
- we turn to new philosophers who feel anguish by knowing what man could be
Chapter 6 we scholars
- protest against men in science declaring their insurance from philosophy, self glorification of learned man
	- like "colorblind ness of utilitarian who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of retired systems and an extravagant expenditure which ' does nobody any good'" - me a few years ago
	- or it's learning to reject all other philosophers from some loved philosophers, but then rejecting that philosophy too and so reject all of philosophy
- without philosophy, shift to instinct of populace
- Science has clearly visible competence while philosophy in its last throes reduced to theory of knowledge and don't dare go beyond its threshold
- philosophies demands from himself verdict of life is worth living and must journey through perhaps destroying and disturbing experiences
- Society often mistakes a scientific man or god intoxicated man with a philosopher
	- hear living wisely as living prudently and apart
	- "Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight,a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the genuine philosopher... lives 'unphilosophical' and 'unwisely', above all imprudently and feels the obiligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life-he risked himself constantly, he plays this bad game." 
- types of man
	- normie, commonplace man
		- Nonruling, no authoritative, non self sufficient
		- Industry, patient adaptable ness to rank and file, equanimity and moderation in capacity and rewuitemny
		- knows what normies want including
			- Rest from labor, claim to honour(supposes general recognition), ratification of usefulness and value
	- Learned man
		- Petty envy, critical of other/higher types of man, unmoved by joy or sympathy, 
- **objective man** is really just a mirror before everything that wants to be known (naive ea)
	- withou with just desire to know and reflect 
	- with his personality seeming to be an arbitrary accident
	- (I was insulted by saying I was just a mirror once, trying to avoid having a personality; is this an ea)
	- Makes mistakes about his needs, here only is he unrefined and negligent
	- when he reflects "**his thoughts always rove away to the more general case**"
	- "he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble" (the mask many men wear) 
	- (stoic) dangerous indifference
	- He can't show much love or hatred, he might even at this point show himself to be false, fragile, questionable, deteriorated
		- Only genuine in so far as he can be objective
		- He does not command affirm deny or destroy
	- overall an instrument, a slave to be cared for and respected but no goal or frame and content, a 'selfless' man
	- Also nothing for women
- When philosopher says he is not a skeptic, masses confused and see it as dangerous
	- "There is...no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism"
		- Skeptic the easily frightened creature loves his noble aloofness his Socrates "I know that I know nothing"
		- Skepticism is the social expression of nervous debility and sickly ness arising from many classes and races suddenly blending 
			- New generation struggles with tentativeness and conflicting virtues preventing any of their cultivation, and most important no will, no feeling of informing of decision
	- objective ness, scientific spirit is just decked out skepticism and paralysis of will 
- France to German to England to Russia from least to most will 
- Skepticism "gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart "
- New philosophers will be more critic then skeptic
	- men of experiment in New dangerous sense, operators more daring than democratic century can approve of
	- Unlike a skeptic, critics have standards of worth and capacity for self responsibility
	- will have a certain considerate cruelty which knows how to deftly handle a knife and be stern even when the heart bleeds
	- will not expect truth to please, inspire or elevate them
			- "that thought elevates me, why should it not be true"
			- "That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful"
	- will have every habit associated with intellectual rigor and purity
- new philosophers will need to be everything from historian and peer to moralist and free spirit to traverse range of human values to then create his own values
- philosophical workers like land and Hegel formalize some existing values subjecting past into intelligible form
	- Real philosophers are law givers and say thus shall it be
		- their knowing is creating, their creating is Law giving, their will to truth is-will to power.
- author finds it obvious that philosopher is indispensable for the future so always contradicts the present
	- Philosophers Mission is to be "the bad conscience of their age"
		- To point out the hypocrisy and self indulgence and self neglect under contemporary morality
- In a vast world of specialties, a philosopher would determine worth based on how much a man could bare and take upon himself(is this the quote)
	- in an age of weakness of will, strength of will and prolonged resolution must be part of greatness
		- In an opposite age, the opposite doctrine of being humble, renouncing, and a selfless humanity would be just as good like in 16th century
			- in Socrates day of old conservatives Atheniansj letting themselves go for the sake of happiness, irony was necessary for greatness
		- **at present where herding animals highest honor, greatness means capable to be different, stand alone, to live by personal initiative. "The most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtue, and of super abundance of will"**
- being a philosophy can't be taught, must be learned through experience
	- all popular ideas about philosophers are false just repeated by people with no experience
- thinking to a philosopher is same as deeply and seriously considering it, thinking as a trouble
- the highest problems repel all but someone predestined to solve it, people who are bred for it in their blood, with generations paving the way and each virtue acquired, nurtured and embodied
Chapter 7 our virtues 
- if we must have virtues, it’s only those in agreement with our secret, heartfelt inclinations
- morality as an attitude has fallen out of style like religious as an attitude did in our fathers time
- psychologist enjoy analyzing the bourgeoise, but how bout looking at Way mediocrity, the rule, behaves towards lofty spirits, the exception
	- mediocre love equality before god and moral standard where they are finally equal to intellectually endowed 
	- they would get mad if you say lofty spiritual is different class than respectability of merely moral man, but instead flatter them by saying lofty is ultimate product of moral qualities
- what interests higher spirits is uninteresting to average man
- Whoever offers sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it or to feel himself more
-  "and after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force with her.”
- **your moral systems should be different according to your rank, universal systems are harmful**
	- "for instance, in a person created and destined for command, self denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues "
- Nothing really fits hybrid Europe so it just wears costumes of moral, beliefs, artistic tastes, and religions and laughs
	- Nothing from this period may last but the laughter as parodists of world history
	- current Europeans have the skill of a historical sense, or ability to quickly understand gradations of valuations a community/people lived by
		- it’s a ignoble sense, great men like Homer and Voltaire and Shakespeare who have a ready disgust for the strange and different struggle to understand this plebeian curiosity/sense
		- men of historical sense are modest, brave, grateful, and habituated to self control
		- What most escapes men of historical sense is the perfection and maturity of any culture, the nobility, the good taste, the glorifications of human life before the infinite
			- we itch for this infinite
- Hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism, modes of thought that value based on pleasure and pain, are looked down on by everyone conscious of creative power/artist conscience
	- **these modes want to do away with suffering, but the discipline of great suffering has produced all of humanity’s elevation**
		- The tension of the soul in misfortune possesses a great energy which creatively undergoes, endures, interprets, and exploits misfortune with whatever greatness the soul has
		- for man is both creature and creator, focusing on just creature suffering when creature is meant and must necessarily suffer is naïveté philosophically
- grumbling slave class strives for power calling it freedom
- we immoralists are woven in a net of duty we can’t disengage from, we are men of duty gnashing our teeth though fools say we are men without duty
- "honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves, we free spirits” for it is our "god”
	- let us be careful lest our honesty became our vanity/sanctity and stupidity for "every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue”
- "Is life not a hundred times to short for us-to bore ourselves? One would have to believe in eternal life in order to…” (… Not my own)
- as few people as possible should reflect on morals, it’s tedious and dangerous
	- "Is moralizing not immoral?”
- English utilitarians want English morality to became the authoritative morality so English happiness is best served, focused on comfort and fashion 
- almost all higher culture is based on cruelty, enjoyment in one’s own suffering and causing others suffering, self denial, repentance, loves cruelty towards himself
	- Every desire for knowledge often has drop of cruelty as you go against your ”fundamental will of spirit” which aims at superficiality/simplicity when you are logical and learn deeply
		- this spirit adopts a preference for ignorance and delight in uncertainty, it turns the New into the old arrangement producing a feeling of growth of increased power
		- this spirit wears disguises to deceive other spirits, wears an outside "for every outside is a cloak”
			- a kind of cruelty towards intellectual taste in every man of knowledge
- there are a class of topics that give us such strong convictions that learning more about the topic can only lead to self knowledge of the great stupidity we embody, like men and women. Here are my truths for women:
	- nothing is "more hostile to women than truth, her great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty"
	- we seek their company because their delicate follies make our seriousness appear as folly to us
	- **"through bad female cooks— through the entire lack of reason in the kitchen— the development of mankind has been longest retarded”** 
	- women are like birds, delicate, wild, animating, to be cooped up to prevent it from flying away
	- Stupid to dream of equal right and obligations, any man of depth must conceive of women as property like Asians 
	- Women believe they are progressing when in fact they are declining even in influence as their rights increase
		- unlearning fear of man which sacrifices her most womanly instincts
		- sacrificing faith in a different ideal for woman and idea women are to be cared for and protected like a house pet
		- slavery isn’ t a counter argument as is a condition of every higher culture
		- do women really want to adopt all the stupidities of European men and general culture and become as incapable of raising robust children
		- Culture and education has never made women influential, it’s her nature and force of will
		- "fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy”
		- there’s no god beneath all this only a modern idea
Chapter 8 peoples and countries
- there are hours when we good Europeans allow ourselves a patriotism of anguish, excitement, and flood of sentiment before returning to reason
	- But duller spirits undergo same flood over time period of months to lifetimes
- two old patriots talking:
	- People mistake massive and power for great, when it used to be greatness required great ideas
	- A statesman that convinced his populace that high politics would subvert their desires and stimukate their passions so it narrowed the mind would be:
		- speaker says strong but not great
		- Other says great cuz it wouldn’t work otherwise
		- Neitzche says stronger may soon become master of the strong
- Democratic movement of Europe by weakening united races produces two types of men
	- mostly mediocrizing of men that is industrious, clever, and gregarious
	- but also slowly emerging super national, nomadic man that is exceptional and dangerous that would shock those pushing these modern ideas
- for future weak willed worker Europeans are ripe for the most subtle sense of slavery and need and cultivate a class of commanders and tyrants that will reach a new height of strength and wealth
- Germans are made up of most extraordinary mingling of races and are contradictory and terrifying
- to German obscure, evolving, and uncertain is deep
	- "The German himself dots not exist, he is becoming, he is developing himself. Development is therefore the essentially German discovery "
	- Conflicting nature like good nature and spiteful was systematized by Hegel and set to music by Richard Wagner 
	- Germany love the convenience of honesty and it’s the most dangerous and successful disguise 
	- people talk of German depth and deception, we know it’s a joke but it’s good and on brand to keep up appearances 
- mozart still speaks to us, last echo of great European taste which had existed for centuries
- Beethoven was last echo during style transition from twilight of eternal loss to eternal extravagant hope
	- Same light as dreaming with Rousseau, dancing during revolution, and adoration before napeleon
- whole music of romanticism is second rate music 
- singers of Beethoven are Rousseau, schiller, Shelley, bryon
- Felix Mendelssohn good musician, Schumann bad
- "There is art in every good sentence - art which must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about it’s TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood”
	- Those without this ear are basically deaf to style 
	- in ancient times everyone knew how to speak so orators lead highest pitch 
- two types of countries and genius which seek each other out
	- Seek to become cause of new modes of life like Jews, Roman’s, and germans
	- seek to be fructified and made to bring forth like Greeks and French
- Europe owes the Jews the entire romanticism, the most attractive elements of Europeans culture gleaming sky
	- "I have never yet met a German who was favorably inclined to the Jews”, but actually antisemitism has dangerous excess it’s prudent to avoid
	- "The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe” owing to resolute faith that only alters very slowly
	- Jews and Russians most likely to impact future of Europe
- The serious European problem is rearing new European ruling caste, the many groups of Europe
	- England lacks real intellectually depth, is why needs religion to moralize
		- Englishman suck at music and dancing
		- there are truths best recognized by mediocre minds like Darwin, John Stuart mill, and Herbert Spencer with a industrious narrowness
			- Highly developed minds are not best for determining common facts, they don’t have to just perceive new, they have to be and represent something new with new values
		- "modern ideas” or "ideas of eighteenth century” or "French ideas” that German mind rose up in disgust against is of English origin with French just best soldiers/victims for
	- French still has most intellectual and refined culture in Europe though its well Concealed
		- high culture men keep their ears closed to the folly of democratic bourgeois 
		- ideas from men like Hegel, Schopenhauer, heine, Paris, taine, and the great henri belle 
		- three things showing intellectual superiority
			- Artistic emotion and form creating great literature
			- Moralistic culture with psychological sensitivity and curiosity, Germans behind centuries
			- synthesis of north and south so can comprehend more than English (maybe north and south is  England and German unclear)
- current nationality is an interlude for Europe wishes to be one
- Richard Wagner and later French romanticism off forties is one Europe spirit we’re great class of discovers and all of them finally sinking down at Christian cross. 
	- is Wagner music german? "for what ye hear is rome- romes faith by intuition”
## Chapter 9 What is Noble?
- every elevation of man has been work of aristocracy society, with gradations of rank and some form of slavery 
	- the ruling caste learns to look and keep down subordinates creating longing for an ever new, rarer higher elevation 
	- Truth is hard
- Every higher civilization originated when men with unbroken strength of will and desire for power, barbarians, dominated weaker, more moral/peaceful race
	- Noble caste always barbarian caste with more psych powers being more complete men
- corruption manifests itself differently depending on organization
	- like French aristocracy at beginning of revolution discarding privileges with disgust was corruption concluding gradual fall of aristocracy into solely royal decoration
- Healthy aristocracy sees itself as highest justification for society sporting then to elevate themselves to higher existence
	- Refraining from violence and exploitation is good conduct, but if taken as fundamental principle is denial of life as life is essentially conquest, exploitation, growth, ascendancy 
		- "life is precisely the will to power”
- **there are two primary types of morality: master and slave**
	- master morality
		- Ruling class good is exalted, proud disposition which determines rank and bad is opposite; ie noble and despicable
			- despicable are cowardly, timid, insignificant, distrustful, and above all liars
				- "We truthful one’s - the nobility in Ancient Greece called themselves”
		- it’s obvious designations of moral values were originally applied to men and only later actions
			- Asking why some action is praised is a mistake, noble men himself is judge and creator of values
				- "‘What is injurious to me is injurious in itself’”
			- **Morality is selfglorification, honoring whatever he recognizes in himself**
		- noble men help unfortunate not out of pity but abundance of power
		- Reverence for all that is severe and hard
		- antisympathy, hostile towards selflessness and acting for good of others
		- "it is the powerful who know how to honor” especially ancestors and not modern ideas and future
		- One has duties only towards equals, but towards rest whatever the heart desires and beyond good and evil
		- Necessity in having enemies as outlet for envy and arrogance
	- slave morality
		- when oppressed and meek moralize it’s a pessimistic condemnation of man and his situation, a skepticism for virtues and happiness of powerful
		- Qualities which help sufferers are exalted like sympathy, patience, humility, and friendliness
		- "Slave morality is essentially the morality of Utility” serving as origin of famous good and evil
			- evil is power and dangerousness, that which arises fear; precisely what master morality calls good 
			- The good man is the safe man, good natured and easily deceived 
		- Desire for freedom, happiness and liberty are to slave morality what reverence and devotion is to aristocratic mode 
			- love as a passion, a European specialty, is of noble origin
- Noble men find vanity hard to understand as its self disrespecting to intentionally believe too much in one’s self
	- historically Ordinary man waits for master to assign him value, even now 
	- **but noble rare impulse of masters to assign value to themselves and to think well of themselves is more and more common and encouraged in our democratic social order mixing blood of slaves and masters**
		- But ingrained in this impulse is an older, ample tendency which creates vanity
	- vain person rejoices over every good opinion he hears about himself regardless of its truth/usefulness and suffers from every bad opinion ie actually just slave morality 
- a type becomes established and strong in long struggle against constant unfavorable conditions, but generates variations in surplus of protection and care as any breeder will tell you
	- look at Greek polis or Venice for human rearing
		- Long struggle needs species that survives learning what qualities to develop and mature
			- Those qualities become virtues 
		- Every aristocracy morality is intolerant in name of virtue justice for education of youth, control of women, marriage customs, relationships of young and old, and penal laws focused for degenerating
		- A stable, hard, warlike species of men emerges creating happy state
			- The old hard species becomes a luxury of taste not necessity and variations both of elevating and denigrating emerge
				- The individual dares to be a individual and detach
			- variations compete in rivalry for growth and self destruction to exploding egoism without restraint of previous morality
			- The individual stands out for self preservation, self elevation, and self deliverance
			- Danger re-emerges in the individual, into friends and neighbor, into heart of people and most personal recesses of desires and volitions 
			- Moral philosophers will discover end is approaching and only mediocre type of man will endure so they preach become mediocre, by talking of moderation, dignity, duty, and brotherly love
- instinct for rank and reverence is sign of high rank and can be used as test of souls
	- vulgarity of many natures emerges when interacting with holy things or great book while great have involuntary silence, hesitation
		- Much is achieved when masses learn of holy experiences which they must keep unclean hands away from
	- believers of modern ideas have disgusting lack of shame 
- **"it is quite impossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution”**
	- Whether diligent modern workers attached to a desk, commander fond of rude pleasures, or men of sensitive conscience sacrificing for god
	- This is the problem of race
	- Three things constituting plebeian type is offensive incontinence, sordid envy,  or clumsy self vacating
	- In our age; education and culture is essentially the art of deceiving heredity plebeianism 
- "Egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul” ie belief others are in subjection and have to sacrifice themselves
	- He acknowledges other equals only as an extension of egoism honoring part of himself in them 
	- Noble gives and takes prompted by instinct of required, giving in return, at root of his nature
- "Make thy heart small” a Chinese proverb is fundamental tendency in late civs
- Words are vocal symbols for ideas which are groups of sensations
	- Not enough to use same words, must also map words to some internal experience or in other words have experiences in common
		- language progresses by making frequently recurring experiences abbreviated and understood more and more rapidly
	- The fear of eternal misunderstandings is what keeps people of different sexes from too hasty attachments
- Whichever group of sensations awaken, speak, and command most readily determines value hierarchy
- language draws together men who can easily communicate which must rely on average and common experiences; this is probably the greatest force acting on mankind pushing towards ordinary
	- More unique and refined man likely to stand alone and seldom propagate 
		- "Succumb to accidents in their isolation” (is this a euphemism for suicide)
- Corruption and ruination of higher men is the rule, the common experience
	- there’s a universal inner desperateness of higher man 
- A psychologist, born soul diviner, requires healing away from what his insight lays upon his conscience in dealing with these broken men 
	- May turn against his lot and self destruct
	- He learns great sympathy and contempt here the multitude, educated, visionaries learn great reverence for great men
		- The multitude workshop a god but the god was only a sacrificial animal 
		- "Success has always been the greatest liar”
		- Work invents who created it, the great creators "are poor little fictions composed afterwards” 
			- The great poets pretend to be stats and the people call them idealists
- only women, who is clairvoyant in world of suffering and eager to help beyond her powers, has learnt of boundless devoted sympathy(is this his def of love) with false belief love can do everything 
	- "He who knows the heart finds out how poor , helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is-  he finds it rather destroy than saves”
	- Holy fable of Jesus is martyrdom of knowledge of love ^1c82c5
		- A innocent, craving heart that demanded frantically to be loved, invented hell to send those who would not love him, and when finally enlightened about human love invented god who is all love but a higher kind, and then sought death ^f8fb85
- every man who has suffered deeply has an intellectual arrogance that by suffering knows more than wisest can
	- "Profound suffering makes noble; it separates”
	- use disguises like Epicureanism and defensive against sorrowful and profound to deny they are broken, proud, incurable hearts
- sense of Purity most profoundly separates man compelling him out of gloom into clearness, depth, and brightness
- "Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the rank of duties for everyone; to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibilities; to count our prerogative and the exercise of them amount our duties”
- Ambition men look on everyone as means of advance or delay/hinderance
- In all injuries, the noble soul is more at risk to grief or perish
- Neitzche has always distrusted self knowledge and believing anything definite about himself
- noble self control needed to only praise what you disagree with which you should do because praising agreement is praising oneself
	- But people confuse praising for being right and then your friends with imbeciles
- to lower oneself onto stupidity and fire of emotions like a horse and ride it for hours
- Great thoughts are like stars, can take generations before light reaches and they will deny stars existence before then
- actions and work don’t indicate noble ness s as its often driven by a need of noble ness, instead "noble soul has reverence for itself”
- one of subtlest means of deceiving by hiding intellect is enthusiasm and virtue
- a recluse who has been in solitude with his thoughts for a year acquires a chilly, repulsive undertone in his words
	- He decides every philosophy is a foreground philosophy with a richer one deeper and it’s suspicious, arbitrary where a philosopher stopped digging
		- "every philosophy also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a lurking place, every word is also a mask”
- "every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood then being misunderstood. The latter perhaps wound his vanity; but the former wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: ‘Ah, why would you also have as hard a time of it as I have?’” ^d4edb3
- man, the cunning deceptive animal, created the good conscience and morality to enjoy the sight of his soul
- a man who can carry out a resolution , remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a women, punish and overthrow insolence in other words a master has sympathy it has value
- "‘laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every thinking mind will strive to overcome’ Hobbes” meanwhile Neitzche would rank philosophers by the quality of their laughing
- Neitzche is the last disciple and initiate of the god Dionysus, the philosopher god
	- Dionysus once said, "i like man, and often think how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound”
- oh Neitzche evil thoughts when they were young they were malicious and full of spices and thorns, but can only be written when they are just about to lose their odor and now they are becoming truths
