 #Book  by [[M.J. DeMarco]]
- Your roadmap guides your actions and leads to where you are now. No one stumbles into their lives. 
- Your roadmap creates [[Beliefs]] which creates [[Choices]] which creates action
- Debt perception, Education perception, Time perception(valuable, fleeting), Money perception(plentiful or scarce), Wealth perception, Destination(is there one), Control, Life perception(today or tomorrow)
- [[Wealth]] is 3Fs: Family and Friend [[Relationships]], fitness and [[Health]], and [[Financial Freedom]]
    - Part 2: Change
    - "Learning something and taking a test on something are two different things".
- [[Money]] can make you comfortable while you are miserable. 
    - Making more money means you are paying this freedom and trading it away. 
    - Money buys not happiness but bondage. 
    - If you think you can afford, you can't afford it. Affordability is only thought about if it's possible you have to rely on it.
    - Money can give wealth if you don't buy into people perception of wealth
    - It can buy you choices, 
    - buying idols will make you sad because it will counter your idea that you should be happy.
- Three roads: the [[Sidewalk]], the [[Slow Lane]], and the [[Fast Lane]]
- [[Poverty]], [[Sidewalk]]
    - Extra focus on events
        - big breaks like lottery
        - Ads with 'you deserve' without process
    - [[Money]] is a hot potato, If you got it flaunt it
    - [[Wealth]] = income + debt
    - [[Faith]] and [[Luck]] and [[Blame]] are the 3 anchors to the sidewalk. You can't hitchhike to the fast lane.
    - Credit and debt are great allows you to enjoy life now
    - Time is abundant
- The Soft Lane, [[Mediocrity]], [[Slow Lane]]

        - scarce must be budgeted
        - Chase the money for your job. 
    - He who dies with toys wins. [[Wealth]] equals money. 
    - Trade time for money
    - Finish school when you graduate. 
    - Life is too short, can't plan. No destination.
    - Focus on events, 
    - Education earns bigger salary
    - Job is income
    - [[Jobs]] are a trade of your time for money with a set limit of pay
    - Wealth acceleration is compounded interest
    - [[Wealth]] takes a lifetime.
    - Actually dangerous and risky
        - Decades of assumptions for slow lane
        - 7 risks: [[Health]], [[Job Security]], home equity, single company risk, powerless of job makes you wasteful in other parts of your life. 
        - Being old and rich sucks.
        - [[Job Security]] haha. Specific skills make you a market place commodity. Your salary and role depends on it.
- [[Wealth]] is a [[Process]] not an event, a journey not a destination
    - If you do what everyone does you will get what everyone does. 
    - You need more than one idea because this is a multi variable equation. 
    - You never hear about the [[Process]] and the ugly part of wealth in the news. 
    - Can't outsource this shit because it's the process that makes you grow. Process creates wisdom.
    - Would you say a poker player is just lucky. No it's all about the process. Poor just care about events.
    - Only you can get you to success. Luck is increased probability. No big hits
- The [[Fast Lane]] gives you control, but get rich quick doesn’t mean easy
- Law of [[Victim]] says you can't be a victim unless you give up power. 
- Responsibility equals accountability. 
- Take your consequences and change your behavior. 
- Instead of building a pyramid stone by stone(slow lane), spend years designing a pully system(fast lane)
- [[Slow Lane]] can be a part of the path, but shouldn't be the path.
- ULL([[Uncontrollable Limited Leverage]])
    - U'll never be rich
    - Can't leverage time it's limited. 
    - Slow lane of 401k takes too long and you'll be old x10. 
    - [[Archive/Slingshow/Education]] can chain you with debt and in a job.
- [[Slow Lane]] try to minimize expenses like saving money on coffee, but you can only save up to your salary
- [[Controllable Unlimited Leverage]]
    - Wealth is exploding wealth and controlling expenses, not living a miser lifestyle cuz time blah blah. 
    - [[Fast Lane]] is [[Entrepreneurship]] into [[Investing]].
- [[Fast Lane]]:
    - Debt is good if I can grow and build system, but parasitic limiting choices otherwise
    - [[Time]] is most important exceeding money
    - If you stop trying to [[Learn]], you stop trying to grow
    - [[Money]] is abundant and reflection of value I created
    - Businesses and investments create money
    - Take assets and create value
    - [[Wealth]] = profit + value
    - Help others better for me
    - I choose how I react
    - Dreams are worth pursuing even at cost of money to
- Become a Producer
    - Reframe yourself from consumer to producer and reorient. See the world as someone who hires, someone who sells shovels. 
    - Whenever anyone sells you something, ask yourself about their business, whats their secret
    - Watch infomericals to see what the pros are doing. 
    - **Uncouple your earnings from time**, like selling a book. Your profit comes from something besides time and is uncapped, you could earn 500 per hour as you sleep
    - [[Wealth]] =net profit+asset value
        - Variables controllable and unlimited 
        - net profit = unit sold x unit profit. 
        - Asset value=net profit x industry multiple
        - Much easier to control then time or salary
    - Of current, pentamillionaries 80 percent got it in lump sum after period of years by small company with explosive growth or company sell. Go fast

    - [[Startups]] is amazing for money trees. 
    - Real estate, content creators. Distribution systems(platforms). Chains and franchisees. 
    - Human resource systems are expensive and complicated. People are difficult and require management dropping passivity systems. 
    - [[Money]] is amazing as passive for interest. 4% for 10 mil is 40k A month. Money is a freedom fighter.
    -  [[Compound Interest]] creates [[Money]] not [[Wealth]].
- You, the Vehicle of Wealth
    - Own you
        - Pay yourself first is slow lane doctrine. 
        - Own yourself so you can actually pay yourself first.

    - [[Law of Effection]]: the more lives you affect the more money you will make
        - Impact millions and make millions. Scale or magnitude needed. 
        - Get a position where you can affect millions a little or a few a lot.
- Choices
    - Fix problems not symptoms like pills.
    - Taking the [[Fast Lane]] is hundreds of choices, not one. 
    - Poor choices is the leading cause of [[Poverty]] and happens slowly
    - Symptoms are your circumstances resulting from hundreds of choices
    - [[Perseverance]] happens everyday not once
    - The common thing in all your choices is you. Choices happen every moment all the time. Slow lane dents this choice. 
    - Bad choices put harm and risk on your life and can change your life potentially permanently.. Like accepting a mortgage or drunk driving. 
    - Younger you are the more potent your choices. Can get set down path and ruins your life. 
    - [[Weighted Decision]]
        - For big decisions with a single number
        - If you can’t decide too many variables
        - Create factors column with weights. For each choice rank 1-10 and you get a number
    - [[Worst Case Analysis]] has 3 questions
        - Worst case? 
        - Probability? 
        - Is this risk worth? 
- Perception
    - Choice of perception and thought patterns motivates actions. Angry or thankful, etc. 
    - [[Money]] is infinite, earning a lot of money is possible.

    - The more uncanny and unnatural you are the more against social norms you need to be. 
    - Parents, friends, education, environment. Anyone who doesn’t power your goals give you head wind and you need to turn your back to them. 
    - Environment headwinds can be your location or something. 
    - Recognize corporate job is a headwind. 
    - Join forums, get around people, you need warriors. Join entrepreneur club. Read books and auto bios, find mentors. Life partners are biggest headwinds.
- [[Time]]
    - People asking for your time are asking for your life. 
    - 3 hours to wait in line for free chicken?? People waiting in line are announcing they value money more than their life. 
    - Indentured time plus free time is bought and paid for by indentured time. Ransom of free time. 
    - Debt and purchases steals your time. Life style servitude. 
    - Fastlaners are frugal with time while Slowlaners are frugal with money.
- [[Learn]]
    - Graduation is not the end of learning
    - You obviously don’t know now what you will need in the future

    - Build and learn about the system, not about how to be a gear in it
    - Make the real world your university.
- Price conveys value. Higher price conveys higher value. It's the reason why slashing prices make you think it's a deal and buy it. 
- Unless commodity, price relies branding.

- Commit
    - Everyone has interest in this. 
    - Commitment is applying the book and working 7 days
    - Mediocre comfort now for meteoric comfort later
