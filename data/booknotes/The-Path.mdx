#Book 

“That is the central theme of this book: that the teachers of these ancient Chinese philosophers, who were responding to problems very much like our own, offer radical new perspectives on how to live a good life.

(2)” Preface

MODERN SOCIETY:

“We aim to live up to the self we were meant to be” rooted in Calvinist predestination

“The fact is that there has been a wide range of visions of how humans can lead lives of their own making. Once we recognize that, we can see the “modern” for what it actually is: one narrative out of many, built from a specific time and place"(7)

Despite advancements, environmental and humanitarian crisises on the rise. “Will [historians] define the early twenty-first century as an age of complacency: a time when people were unhappy and unfulfilled: when they witnessed growing crises but failed to respond, feeling there to be no viable alternatives?”(8)

“Many of [the philosophies were actually developed in opposition to the idea of living according to any overarching system of thought”(8).

“We will see that not only have people been debating how best to organize the world since long before the modern era but also that there are true alternatives in thinking about how to live well”(9)

“In the face of life’s uncertainty we are take comfort in the belief that by overcoming emotion and bias and reducing our experience to measurable data, we can master chance and defy fate(9);

“The [trolley problem] allows us to reduce decision making to a simple set of data and a single choice…[Chinese thinkers thought] you can play these games all day long, and they will have no impact on how you live your ordinary everyday life. None whatsoever. (10).

“Your response would have nothing to do with rational calculation.. Our emotions…(10)

1. We just.a modern world, no relation
    1. We sad, unhappy, and unfulfilled. Chinese philosophers offer real alternatives to dominant thought
    2. We rely on our rational mind to plan for happiness, but the way we think we live isn’t the way we actually live. Our emotions and instincts guide our responses, not deliberate rationality. Chinae philosophers want us to hone our instincts and cultivate our emotion so we always react in the right and ethical way9-11
    3. The goal is live life authentically to our true selves. But, this means narrowing the definition of who we are and could be. We are actually complex and ever-changing. Who you are is cultivated through action not thought. Change is slow, but possible. By boxing yourself into a category, you begin to see your actions as those of your lens. If you are bad at tennis, good hits are flukes and your body and mind expect failure. It has been shown that self-confidence has a real impact on performance. Throughfore, what you believe about yourself becomes the reailty about yourself. Believing you are an introvert for example allows an explanation for your refusal to be social though you could if you tried. And if you tried then maybe you would become a little less introverted. Like a skill a spectrum, you can’t just wake up and be everyone’s friend. But, you can make individual decisions that lead to more social interaction which lead to slightly more comfortable which lead to you palling for more social interaction.11-

“The Way is the path that we forge continually through our choices actions and relationships(14)

Philosophers agreed the process of building the way is valuable though they disagree about what perspective to build.

25 - Confucious question how we live our lives

26-27 we are animals ruled by emotion

31 Spirits, actions can be good for how they affect you

“The key for the players is to be conscious that they are pretending; that together they have entered an alternate reality in which they imagine different sides of themselves. If they can do this, then not only will experiences like playing hide-and-seek help cultivate a mutually more joyful and respectful relationship, but also these accumulated moments will influence the sort of person each becomes over time(36).

“It doesn’t really matter whether Santa Claus is real or not. What matters is that their behavior changed for the better, and they are brought close to one another”(38).

“He understood that seemingly minor actions such as arranging the place where people would sit with him would create a different environment that could affect them profoundly(40).42-47

“Confucious would not define goodness; he wanted his disciples to know that we must feel it in all theses different, shifting situations to understand what it means to express it. We have all felt it, and once we recognize it, we can develop it further”(47)

- People have an intuitive sense of goodness. Despite the fact we are constantly changing human beings with unrefined sensibilities. Goodness is something we all can intuitively know and work towards.

“Trying to formulate abstract ,universal laws to guide us is not only irrelevant but also dangerous. It prevents us from learning how to wrestle eight the complexities of situations(49).

1. Minor aspects of our lives

Instead of lofty ideas and great pensivee readings, people needed direction in the way to live their lives. The moment to moment present is where we actually live and lead out lives and thus the main place where we an affect. If we are spending 95% of our time doing mundane things that that is the part of our lives we should be optimizing and improve for the greatest impact. The world is much to messy for universal rules and adages. The greatest global rules can fall prey to absurd scenarios and contrived examples, but the actual application and usage is what matters. It’s here and now. We may think it lies in our rational mind, but we ofrten don’t think we respond. We can use our rational mind to cultivate good habits and create systems in which its easier to be a good person, but in the end our instinct and reactions are the way we act and these hide beneath the surface of our conscious emerging briefly into the world as actions based on some cue.

1. rituals

Confucious believes to refine our sensibilities and change ourselves in this ever-changing world we can look to rituals. Rituals to Conscious are defined as…… [RESPONSE] Which means they provide benefit for the individual and theose around them. Only if the ritual is truly internalize(child quote about dining table), you learn it first then you understand the significant. k

1. Ever-changing people

The world is turbultate and changing. We constantly fit ourselves to world and the world changes us for it. We are constantly refine and responding to world which instills habits and teaches us about our environment training our model of the way the world works and how we stand with in it. But western ideology, often focusing on finding your true self as if tie as something you lost. A trye self exists within you that you just need to bring out. Contrary actions to some deep self are insincere and should be avoided. If you are an introvert, then going out and attempting to connect with people is a contrived excessive contrary to your creation. But, this idea is limiting. But saying what you are you are saying whatyou aren’t and what you can’t do. It is a lens that you use to look at the world and suddenly everything becomes that way.

1. Goodness, intuitiva sense not truth

But, what exactly are the rituals we should change and towards what goal. Conficious would say we would know intitutiatavlexy , but I would see western pihilopsohwas a way to answer this question. Nag rituals is directed towards something and there is no reason if we are changing individual with perspectives influencing how we view the world that our sense of goodness can also be dsitrorted . Such a n extreme can occur that we see goodness as evil and evilas goodness. In this case, want movement and changing and so called imporvemdn tis detrimental because our conception of it is wrong. This iwhat the vagueness means. But the two philosphies don’t exist in isolation. Conficous elevates the analysis of our data to day lives to a higher level and that proviedes us value in changing our lives. DOn’t fall into the age of complacency as the book defines, but seek to constantly change and improve yourself. We need direction in our changing world. .
