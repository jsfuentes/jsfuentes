        - After 7 years, land would be distributed to share holders
        - Owning land in me world for just labor was intincing
        - Turned out to be a disasters, people kept dying or going to India
            - Many bailouts required
        - Loved Holland group
    - Final deal

    - Company got 3 pounds per orphans to send them to Virginia
- Slaves vs indentured servitude
    - Early indentured
        - 7 years of indentured servitude to get land and shelter
        - 487 whites were servants
        - 23 slaves this early
        - Demand side
            - Slaves require upfront investment, but Virginia was so inhospitable people died very often. Indentured servant dying is cost less or even profitable
        - Supply side
            - A huge demand in the West Indies for sugar which was closer
        - Maryland after Queen, would be just built on British Catholics
            - 1672 founded
            - 75% came as servants

- New England has sabbath and least religious free, rest wanted money
- Carolina offer 150 acres per member of family that comes over, slaves were counted so slaves were majority of the colonies
- No cash crop in New England, got urban occupation
- Tabacoo, super important
    - Virginia and south got tabacoo with plantation being unit of town and huge wealth grow too
    - Tabacoo from Maryland and Virginia was 80% of export from colonies
    - Scales of farming, entire slave communities with families and so new slaves.
    - Native slave never was free so barely knows what freedom to chase or how
    - Plantations like to borrow against future crop to smooth seasonality
        - Even George and Thomas would depend on London benefactors
        - Tabacoo sent to benefactors and sent back luxury goods for high life
- So many rivers just went directly to sea instead of having a centralized port in Chesapeake bay
    - Trading went to north instead
    - Trading had new information flow and so greater opportunity so north would come to dominate eventually

    - One year after, parliament summoned Benjamin Franklin to distinguish from external and internal taxes
        - External commodities imported
        - Internal tax forced by people, can’t marry or make contract so can only ruin us if we don’t pay
    - Thought colonies would eventually revolt if just this small revenue of less than 1% of their income
    - But instead stamp act repealed
    - Americans tasted power of collective action
- After 7 years, British started taxing external imports and sugar act for commodities
    - Now obvious taxing import and export could control what goods could be bought and exported so favored a British interest over colonies
    - Boycott so British could barely pay for administrative not even standing army
    - Smuggled tea lowered tea revenue though it was one of the few taxes not repealed after protest
    - First shipment of new tea with less taxes would make it price competitive but taxed by British
    - So Boston Tea Party with painted faces dumped 45 tons of tea
- British closed the harbor and revolutionary war would start within years

        - Modest improvements bypassed patent
        - Eli’s early facility burned down and at the end of it so many infringing units it didn’t have advantage
    - Eli just started suing but seemed dumb to many in south
