title: 'Myth of the Rational Voter'
---

#Book by [[Bryan Caplan]]


Intro
- "Caplins book is a treat but he would never win elected office"  economist 
- "Even an unsuccessful book will probably have more readers than any of your articles"
Intro the paradox of democracy
- dictatorships policies are appalling but rarely baffling 
- Protectism tariffs are baffling as it's criticized by economists
- How does democracy give safe harbor to bad policies? 
	- Several answers: 
		- Elections weak deterrent and special interest more important
		- people are deeply ignorant and don't know representatives 
		- Could defend public opinion as more correct than experts like price control/tarriffs
- "Voters are worse than ignorant, they are irrational" thesis
	- some policies just feel good 
	- Criticism of all human institutions 
	- Why control knee jerk reaction if one vote doesn't matter? 
- Three themes
	- doubts of rational voters are justified
	- Voter irrationality is economically reasonable if assume some reasonable motivations 
	- Irrational voters are key to realistic democracy 
- People think democracy fails because it didn't do what people want, but it fails because it does what voters want
- Most of cost of voters irrationality is paid by others, externalities 
- Will be insightful to when democracy fails, compare to markets not communism
- "Democracy is widely overrated "
Chapter 1 beyond the miracle of aggregation
- Voters have rational ignorance, since their vote doesn't effect outcome 
	- not transitory citizen apathy
-  Voters don't know they are doing, just leave it to market
- Wisdom of crowds
	- Average time for a race is worse then best racer obv, but average answer is often better then smartest
		- "It like we have been programmed to be collectively smart"
	- Maybe even irrational voters can do well
		- Assume voters don't make systemic errors but random and there are some informed voters like 1% 
		- democracy with 1% informed looks more like completely informed then 0% informed
			- If random voters,  so informed will be the one worth convincing 
	- who wants to be millionaire crowd is 91% accurate 
	- Miracle of aggregation makes democracy work not informed voters, equal say to wise and not so but wise determine policy
- reality of systemic error
	- miracle of aggregation works only if people don't make systemic errors in voting
	- Are voters errors systemic on questions of direct politically relevance? 
		- People have anti market bias, underestimate foreigners, prosperity conflated with work
		- Average sees no link between high wages and low employment 
		- balance of trade focus absurd, consider trade surplus as a gain and their loss
	- Economists expect voters to understand economics and not have systematic error , but not students they have known bias to overcome
- Tobe enthusiast is to have emotions overcome logic, Locke essay 
		- Neitzche, "faith means not wanting to know what is true"
		- Ideaologies, pride, vanity, other emotions 
		- Part of price of unhealthy diet is shorter life span 
		- Democracy makes price of adhering to your ideology very low as your vote, so free to whatever makes you feel best
- consumers don't shrewdly vote their pcoket books
	- Elder less supportive of social security and women less supportive than men of prochoice
- politics is therefore about creating illusion and following polls not good policy
	- Demogogre, a leader who use popular prejudice and false claims to gain power, but it's the winning strategy
	- Shreking, is not following voters will and should be more acceptable
		- It's possible if voters don't have strong preference like what word you use
	- **media also gives voters what they want, you might think media creates popular fallacy but the fallacies preceded modern media** 
- Summary: Voters have beliefs and support policies that in their mind are socially beneficial. Successful candidates usually actually believe voter views. Special interests look for concessions where people don't have strong opinions. Media are watchdogs because people are entertained by scandal but don't conflict user vote beliefs
- Economy is considered one of the most important issues, so these biases are important 
- **Most people see either well functioning democracy or democracies high jacked by special interests, but author sees democracy's that fail because they listen to voters**
	- (Bryan Caplans perspective is incentive design is the problem when a system ritually fails despite various attempts at fixing it)
Chapter 2 systematically biased beliefs about economics
- Econmists hostile to idea of peoples systematic biases in research 
- Many systemic bias but perhaps it's just contrived experiments not real world
- Voter bias
	- Ask factual questions, people overestimate foreign aid and welfare size as percent
- Enlightened perference
	- Calculate political iq using factual qs like how many senators whose chief justice etc
	- Then keep all demos the same except political iq and see how beliefs change
	- Informed respondents are
		- more interventionist and more dovish for defense spending
		- more progressive legal issues like gay rights, prochoice
		- more Fiscally conservative preferring free market and less powerful gov
		- more equal opportunity and less equal results
	- Maybe pro market cuz rich but the informed effect is strongest for poorest 
- Economists would be better if they addresses prejudice like they do while teaching
- Anti market bias 
	- thinks Profit interest must have anti social effect
	- people see profits as transfer so you like it if you like the receiver and not the supplier
	- Older prejudice then profits is loans and interest rates as creditor is often rich. Muslim hates interest
	- Tradeable environmental permits would let the easiest to make cleaner be able to do it and sell it, so you get more per dollar than bans
	- Middleman do storage, transportation, and distribution not nothing
	- Greed damages sellers reputation
- Anti foreign views
	- Foreigners seem to have special power to take advantage of us
	- Smith noted we should trade with everyone if they make it better or cheaper
	- Canadian less foreign than Japan
	- If we had more immigrants, we would have less trade deficit as Mexican works here and then sends money back very similar
- Trade surplus doesn't matter
	- Comparative advantage 
	- Why worry about drain if money from nation but not city or family? Why just foreign purchases
- Make work bias
	- Saving labor is not benefit but danger because destroy jobs not just increase productivity
	- More jobs with more goods to produce or make people less productive 
	- idea machinery creates unemployment and debt eventually crashing capitalism, but if you don't need the labor why are you wasting
	- no individual would break his tools 
	- Problem is work has become an end instead of a means because consumption separated from producing so they done by different people
- Pessimism about economy both on individual issues and overall
	- Always had idea that people becoming too technological
	- Hume blames psychology as nature to hating present an admire past
	- collapse of western culture predicted for 150 years but it only expanded in that time
	- Pessimist says gdp doesn't account for environmental quality 
- Anti market, anti foreign, make work bias, and pessimistic bias are most prominent economic biases 
- Are there evidence for these biases?
Chapter 3 evidence from survey of American and economists on the economy 
- Popular opinion is wrong, Krugman says public has systemic bias
- tariffs
	- "tariffs and import quota usually reduce general welfare of society" 72.5% mainly agree, only 6% disagree
	- public always leans for protection 66% thought they were necessary 
- Anti market bias,
	- 2/3 of economists disagreed price controls should be used to control inflation
	- 2/3 of public think it's gov job to keep prices under control
- Surveys between public and economists generally don't ask exact question
	- SAEE, survey of Americans and economists asks both the same questions
- But do differences between experts and public mean there is systemic bias, experts can be biased too?
	- Economists arent experts on the economy but just experts in economists, and so relying on experts elevates elite opinions
	- Economists often disagree
	- Marx called economists capitalist apologists 
	- two doubts
		- Self serving bias, perhaps whatever benefits economists, a high paid tenured position 
		- ideological bias, new market fundamentals perhaps a long chain letter brainwashing gen 
- Enlightened public, what would happen if all demographics were the same but they had phd in economists 
	- Keeping demographics the same can remove self serving and ideological bias
	- only 20% of belief differences are due to demographics, so 80% are greater knowledge/credentials
- Results from SES, economists worry
	- In general economists think problems are overstated
	- less about excessive taxation because rich worry less about taxes because public is convinced its getting a bad deal
	- less about Federal deficit 
	- wayyy less about Foreign aid, economists criticize forgin aids effect on foreign countries
	- less about immigrants coming in, weak evidence immigrants depress wages but considerable immigrants pay more in taxes then they consume
	- less about companies paying too little in tax
	- the same about education and job training, economists see this as the biggest problem for us as it has positive externalities
	- less about too many people on welfare, as public worry too much about incentive to not work as it's the worst workers
	- less about affirmative action for women and minorities, as too few lawsuits to cost much
	- less about weak work ethic, but economists see free time and less emphasis on work as a luxury good 
	- less about gov regulation but 5th largest and 3rd smallest. 
	- equally distressed about low saving rates. Savings is double taxed as interest is taxed and has positive externality
- Looking at enlgihtened voter summary 
	- don't care about high executive pay, low taxation, automation, outsourcing, downsizing(productivity)
	- Care about productivity(same input more output), job training 
	- Largest gaps is in foreign aid and outsourcing work
	**- Public love women in labor but not immigrants, same effect right?** 
	- Public surprisingly positive about trade deals for foreign bias
	- - Economists think prices are supply and demand like oil prices while less than a quarter agree
		- Why do prices ever fall if it's greed?
	- both agree about power of president and rising inequality
	- Public pessimist about current state
		- Abnormal for new jobs to be low paying
		- Mean income rose, but I can't tell abou median
		**- Economists predict rising living standards and enlightened public actually more optimistic because high incomes males** are pessimistic
		- On current state of economy, economist optimist disappear when controlled by job security 
- what might explain these two differences
	- Public might differ by time horizon, procapitalist requires long run
	- SES says major and minor problem, too vague
		- When ask numbers they reflect a massive foreign aid
- Conclusion
	- Almost no area where systemic differences don't exist
	- Self serving and idealogical bias not found
	- education important 
		- 19 where education and economic training move together and only two that move apart
		- Moving from bottom to top of education ladder has half effect of Econ PhD 
## Chapter 4 classic public choice and the failure of rational ignorance 
- it is irrational to be politically informed because of low returns and time cost
	- Unless you are the flip vote then you marginal impact is zero
	- If everyone thinks this bad for everyone, but if I think this way not bad for me
- explains Low knowledge
	- Less then 40% of people know both senators name and parties
	- Half know two senators per state and quarter know senator term
- if people don't condition their vote on candidates action, then candidates don't have to listen
	- Voter rational ignorance
- Interest groups are affected greatly so care
- two blames of false beliefs
	- iirational, dogmatic about mind
	- Uniformed, uneducated about info
- different types of rationality
	- Rational expectations, efficient maximizing output for input, isn't about ends but means
		- needs Absence of systemic errors 
	- Bayesian, as long as you update according to Bayes even if your wrong it's fine
	- Truth seeking, effort
- difference between irrational and ignorance
- Can only ignorance explain democratic failure? 
	- If ignorance is problem, then enough info dumps can solve 
		- with all relevant info can't convince a majority of protestors
	- If ignorant then randomish error
	- people want to learn about world without sacriricing their worldview
	- Ignorant doesn't mean impressionable, can ignore biased info/propaganda
- Voter are ignorant because of selfishness 
- If informed are biased, then uninformed dominated
	- Don't need to weigh every decision, can just impose huge punishment if you are found out
		- but penalty isn't heavy enough, Politician can break all his promises and at worst get a nice corporate job
			- Asymmetric info, in car salesman you know you are being scanned so demand clear info and if you are in doubt say no. 
				- So voters should say no, and go for less government
- maybe uninformed reach same conclusion
	- At intersection could know everything about drivers about mind and cars or just look at signal
	- Could just follow brand or friend advice which is as well informed as you would be so you may know nothing but be just as good
	- maybe just look how good  country is and re elect of good without caring how, retrospective voting
		- But intangible knowledge should follow tangible knowledge, need to know term limits and powers to actually assign blame
		- but studies show articulate knowledge creates different views
- 3 paths to democratic failure, extreme stupidity, lack of competition, or high info transfer cost
	- Ignorance isn't enough
		- would expect error to cancel out, media bias to be accounted for, and punishments to scale expecting information assymetry
	- Instead irrationality
		- Could believe media if horror studies and punish minor transgression like scandals more than campaign broken promises
- could be rational consumer and irrational voter
## chapter 5 rational irrationality
- are they irrational voters and consumers or just voters
-
