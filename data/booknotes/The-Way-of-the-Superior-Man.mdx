title: 'The Way of the Superior Man'
---

#Book by David Deida
## Key Ideas:
A spiritual guide to mastering the challenges of women, work, and sexual desire
- "may this book serve the liberation of your true gifts so that countless multitudes of being may benefit even more from your living and loving"
- "a man's worth can be found in his depth of being and awareness", 
	- "The way of the superior man is  the way of deep gaze, breath, and purpose" 
- male is purpose and clarity of vision, women is sensual. Now women more independent and men more sensitive and yielding 
- Have gone from housewife to 50-50, but now women depressed from stress
	- Unhappiness in intimacy 
	- real passion needs ravasiher and ravishee
	- anyone can have masculine or feminine at any time, but you need it for attraction
- in moments of intimacy, one must play the masculine to get strong sexual polarity
	- don't need it for love but you need it for sexual passion
- This book for masculine sexual essence since you attract your sexual opposite
- Masculine about Mission and search for freedom and succeeding at mission and putting it on the line if he doesn't have balls to do it himself he will watch it on tv and sports
- search for love is feminine and filled with love and women will watch soaps and ice cream 
- sports is masculine emotion while beholding good team of people living at their edge
- 90% have a preference
- Shed pretense and live with your core
- Sameness does not work in intimacy, afraid of true and real love, love is openness
- Real balance will not be particularly attracted, masculine will be pulled to the feminine
- "Unadorned suffering is the bedmate of masculine growth. Only by staying intimate with your personal suffering can you feel through it to its source...You were born as a sacrifice. And you can either participate in the sacrifice, dissolving in the giving of your gift, or you can resist it, which is your suffering"
## Part 1 a man's way
Chapter 1 stop hoping for completion of anything in life
- men make mistake of thinking one day they can rest or one day things will be different, but it wont
	- spend one hour a day at least doing whatever you want to do 
	- Do what you are born to do today, what you deeply feel you need to do in your heart
- another mistake is one day women will be fundamentally different 
	- assume that your women today will never change
		- if you find it intolerable leave, but if it's just distasteful or a hassle know feminine always seems chaotic and cooled to masculine
		- When she is being this weird energy, hug/touch/scream at her and say you love her this way
			- learn to find humor
- "Men who have significant lives are men who have never waited, not for money, security, ease or women"
	- Every moment waited is a moment wasted
Chapter 2 live with an open heart even if it hurts
- better to live with open hurting heart than closed one
- Notice if you respond to a situation by closing off or hiding, notice if you find it difficult to look into someone's eyes
	- These are signs of unskilled reaction to hurt, trapped in your self protective tension(go for a hug)
	- A superior man practices opening during these times stand up straight and open chest and breath and eye contact feel your own pain can your fullest intelligence interact with the situation
Chapter 3 live as if your father is dead
- be free of father and his expectations and criticism 
- How would you have lived different if you never felt burdened by your father
Chapter 4 know your real edge and don't fake it
- honorable for man to share fears, shouldn't pretend he is more or less enlightened 
- Where edge is less important then living it 
- all men are afraid and if you lie people will feel your fear even if you don't
- some men lack aliveness of man living at his edge, these men hang back and other men don't trust this man since he won't push them to live at their edge
Chapter 5 always hold to your deepest relaization
- enternity must be a man's home, glimpse and stabilize the realization and hold your life around it, depth of being
	- that which makes your attention conscious and aware

- read books and spend time with people who remind you of your source
- Know eternity, do whatever it takes 
Chapter 6 never change your mind just to please a women 
- make a new decision with new information, but don't go along with her and ignore your wisdom
	- Listen and then make a decision, make the decision you know to be best 
	- listening to her means you don't trust your wisdom so why should she
- Say my deepest wisdom is leading me to this decision and if I'm wrong I'll learn from it
	- I am willing to be wrong and grow from it, this self trust makes others trust you
	- don't deny yourself opportunity to grow from your mistakes
Chapter 7 purpose must come before your relationship
- "if a men prioritizes his relationship over his highest purpose, he weakens himself, disservices the universe, and cheats his women of an authentic man that can offer his full undivided presence"
- know that you would rather fulfill your highest purpose then the perfect intimate relationship
	- "Your mission is your priority, unless you know your mission and have aligned your life to it, your core will feel empty, your presence in the world will be weakened as well as you presence with your intimate partner"
	- If women interrupting you, tell her you love her but can't deny your hearts purpose and give her some set time of full attention
		- she would rather have 30 minutes of absolute attention and presence, then a few hours of weak divided presence
Chalter 8 lean just beyond your edge
- lean just beyond your edge, comfort, and fear in everything

Review: Great book. The most positive, inspiring perspective on masculinity I've ever seen. And in exploring femininity and masculinity, he explores two archetypes of a fulfilling life: the sensual flow of love in your life and living on your edge with clarity of vision and purpose. A spiritual book rather than anything scientific or proven. While I have to genuflect to modern ideals and say the model is reductive, I think this book offers a powerful perspectiv. 
4 stars
