title: 'Educated'
---

Thisüëèbooküëèslapsüëè. One of the best books I read in a while and I finished it in two days. It‚Äôs an absolutely wild life story that's deeply engrossing, violent, dramatic, and reflexive. The memories are explored in their jumbled confusion and words chatter in her mind. Her family is the protagonist and antagonist, the abusive lover. The author has this brilliant ability to articulate her internal struggle and pull out emotional themes. It has this profound, stirring rawness that deeply struck me; shame, guilt, and triumph. Ideas and tropes that feel strangely relatable. Reignited my passion for reading, I want more of this in my life!  
  
"You could call this selfhood many things, transformation, metamorphosis, falsity, betrayal, I call it an education"

This book slaps. I read it in days. It‚Äôs engrossing, violent, dramatic, reflexive . The memories are explored in their jumbled confusion and words chatter in her mind. Journals and words. Her family is the protagonist and anatoginst the abusive lover. Shame and guilt and triumph. Crazy story. The author has a depth in her memories pulling out emotional themes and reflections that resonate. Ideas and tropes that feel strangely relatable. Reignited my passion for reading, I want more of this in my life
