title: 'The Gulag Archipelago'
---

Considered to help with demise of societ union, one critic in Russia said so. He was sure Soviet state would collapse and be would rerun in 1987 before fall of Soviet Union. He states 60M died by politics, but many different estimates how to attribute. Moral matters because line between good and evil goes through the line of every human heart. He believes this isn’t politics, but timeless moral lens. He went from communist to religious.

Arrests

So random. Night time arrests. Pull someone in office, bicyclist, someone who stays with you for religious reasons, off the operating table. Pretend to know the man and pull him aside from his wife. Why if they would compile and very little resistance. “For what?” No reason has ever been given. No real reason political is no reason but people have quotas. Some are prepared and some feel relief, after all they arrested people like you and what are they waiting for. One guy hid for 7 years and was so harried life he enjoyed arrest. Why not resistance? Leading you or openly with pistols. Why not outcry? He kept silent and was even left out often after being arrested, lead his man to the prison. You can’t make it worse. They dont release you. He wanted to cry out to 200M not 200. He was soldier and called into office, gave pistol them under arrest. Actually got answer why, caption said you have friends in Ukraine front(they tried to stop him) and he spoke his hands and said I wish you happiness. Meet officers that drunkenly found girls bathing and they got away, but one of the girls were counter intelligent wife. If German , could be rapped, Russian could be chased and playfully hit but.

History of sewage disposal system

First two waves for arrests were peasants, biggest fire is not calling out. But 1937 was people off position with pens and many was written. First was burgeiogous Prison sewers were never empty. Destroyed other political parties. Took over church by putting head on trial and rounding up everyone who supported him and ordinary believers and bishops. Women especially the religious were common arrests and called nuns. Ten was longest term and given to nuns. Prostitution were three  and could return doing their craft with guards and could return home. Nuns never returned. Raised taxes on rich then arrested them for bankruptcy and confiscated property. Needed money and gold, arrested anyone who could possibly have gold so arrested, many didn’t. Standard waywas Put everyone in cell and feed with salty food  with no water. One gold piece for water. Forced resettlement of whole families naked, first time done and massive. Copied by Holocaust and Stalin with other nationality. 10 years for people stealing food. Conference for 5 minutes of cheering, who would be first to stop. 10 minutes with fake hope. 11 minutes Director of paper factory sit down and everyone stopped dead and sat down. And he was arrested that night with some other reason. Every city had quota of arrests and just needed to be ingenious. Like infection, I can shake your hand and your done. Wives arrested for failing to renounce husbands. Left weapons and forte intact in Lithuania with war starting but didn’t forget many families and shooting jails.all Germans arrested even if party officials.people who stayed in city abandoned by authority. People seeing west were separated even more. In Sweden group stayed there and spoke of capitalism. Sweden found out and wrote articles. Soviet Union fattened then let them grow hair have them sure and did press conference shout how they are fine. They completed their 10 year term. Russians given back by allies and sent to camps, allies say on this. Against the people will, turned over. This is just political, there was nonpolitical too. 1947, 46ths was new wave. 12 years old got grain, 20 years and quarter 25 was maximum. Previously only failure of denouncing, but now not reporting anything. These were added after fascism won. Re arrested all political enemies and all their children. Tortured with genitals crushed under boot, bitten by ants, hot rod put up ass. Something that stopped with Catherine’s Russia. No investigating, just inquiry. Put revolver on table and say talk. Torture needed for 1938 on, but nothing would do people who needed confessions. Everything permitted. After war, pulled back with permissions, but enabled torture for certain classes of people. Confession is most important. Relative truth book written said you can’t really know someone is guilty so it’s all relative and you do m shouldn’t need conclusive evidence. People used latest knowledge for torture. Bonus pay for night work, Stalin have no direct orders but make sure it was used. How to not leave marks? 1) night, more vulnerable 2) Persuasion in sincere tone, “look just confess, you will be arrested anyway” butIf you don’t well your health... 3) Ble yourself not party obviously if your a party official. 4) sudden reversal of tone, friendlyInto threat willed great with women 5) good cop bad cop 6) preliminary humiliation, lie face down in corridor until taken to interrogation 7) women naked with male jailers 8) extreme confusion, women officer underdressed in stages with interrogation as if nothing going on. 9) camp depends on us or Confess and we send you back 10) intimidation with summons as they have a lot to lose 11) lie with documents and friends, skillful . If you don’t sign this, you will destroy him to relatives. Interestingly kinship not evidence. Concern for those he loves. Play wife screaming in next room, or show her. Just summoned. Speak more and more loudly. Scream in ears. Tickling with noses while tied down. Bright lights in small cell. Continuous state of being lead to interrogation and cell. Usually shut into box with first time for hours or days. Seated on stool for 6 days without anything to lean against. Pushed into pit for home and bathroom for weeks. 3 and a 1/2 ounces a day and a glass of water. Stand on knees without heels. Good with women. Urinated in face on proud people. Stand one day can be enough. No water. Combinations. Sleeplessness destroys people, cheapest part of method and core. No closing eyes. Bed bugs. Punishment cell always worse. Cold starvation. Ice water for feet. Show attractive food to hunger with wine and in pleasant life sign. Groin hit, usually causes unconsciousness. Fingernail, break back.

Don’t condemn those that confessed more than they should have. Soviet code? None have seen it until released publicly when out of use. Even says they shouldn’t do threaten and give real facts. Can give corrections. Haha. Couldn’t lie to old guard, but worked on new. Tried to implicate as many people as possible. Stuffed so many prisoners in a cell they had no ground. 3 people for every square foot, torture by no use. Prisoners body and breathing made it hot. When you saw results, disheartening. Crazy nerves destruction. People in cell whisper in you ear especially the loyal to party. Only man who has renounced everything can stand it already thought to be dead for himself and others. One man was liberated after extensive torture as would be useless on trial.

Chapter 4 the bluecaps

Clear to workers it was all fabrication. How could they work year after year? Didn’t nazis also just follow instruction? Cynicism and loved it. Wife told neighbors how good an interrogator was. Promotions and effort. Less arrests means fired. War. Greed for power and gain. Enter a room with blue and no one has more power than you not army commander or factory manager. You are always right and have special considerations. Do organs want and they will take care of you. How to make it fun? Don’t control your furry! Control women they have no choice, no reason to feel shy. Fool not to make use of position in society, other wives or whatever you want. Anything you want or women or enemy was yours will. Had to holy to refrain. 75% were about greed and so petty. Allowance of cigarettes for prisoner, some just kept all and said they spent more hours. Maybe some blue caps didn’t steal, but author can’t imagine given their life philosophy. If your life came different, could you have been executive. MKDB school, why not go in college? Didn’t make sense materially, but something instead revulsion inside us. If only we could separate evil from us, but line goes through every human being. Line keeps changing. Only by luck they were executioners or we weren’t. One guard tried to warn priest, she lectured guards and they gathered unbridled passions bad but why persecute best people, religious. Selfless people. In stories, people believe their evil and know they hate, but no the way it is. To do evil, must first think it’s good with justification. Ideology good in his and others eyes. When you cross threshold to evil, you have left humanity behind without possibility of return. Only 86k arrested in Germany need more! Why they punish their people. Once even criminal was regulated by his crimes and didn’t want to live. For sake of people, put their crimes on trial to face their fate. Should reject one group can oppress another’s. Will be horrible to live in country where any mortality goes.

First Cell first love

First cell will always hold a special place on your heart. Your first cell mates family. Rethink your life and meet others like you. Out of the cell/box alone and intro interrogation. Sohannku, worst prison no one left alone or sane. One man gives us all this info and invited Mattis of measuring cell. Found way to sleep standing up to not go insane. Always watched.

Stool pigeons often in cells. Would either instantly open his heart to people or close off to some. Told secrets  that would make heads roll, never told wrong person. Old man in cell, old political prisoner. Taught author his ideas hoping he would carry them on. 12 gun salute said enemy capitalis had fallen and war was over. Victory not for them.

That Spring

That spring of winning the war had so many Soviet war prisoners and anyone who had spent anytime in Europe or officers with experience with west. Mostly men of authors generation and answered call and won war. We’re not traitors to the motherland, but everyone referred to them as traitors of the motherland. They were betrayed by motherland called forth to war, badly lead, and called back to be ensared. Not allowed to surrender, prisoner of war is illegal means submitting. To prove innocence, during your stay in prison call witnesses in other camps if even alive. Guilt presumed. Hitler didn’t allow Russian liberation movement and only let Russian soldiers attack western front at some point. Should have known need political movement to overthrow Russian gov but was more worried about that victory. This war showed Worst thing in the world was to be Russian. West slowed down so Russia could liberate Prague. Russians surrendered to Americans, but just returned to Soviet’s as Americans didn’t understand difference. How could people not want to return home. Some killed them selves rather than return. On announcement of forced return, people held their own funeral service. Allies of the western allies. Even from US territory. Hundreds of thousands of Russians fight against their own land, first time in history. Basically all emigres jailed. When they got to ussr, often under false pretenses. Some allowed to live for a few years, some immediately jailed

In the engine room

8 years in gulag for author. For anti Soviet propaganda and trying to create anti Soviet unit. Signed. Was anticlimactic. SOS. All about espionage and subversion. One category was member of a family connected by code. Didn’t sentence, but give administrative penalty. Improvement and loss of all property. Independent and no appeals above or low. Sentences often charged. Court codes published in newspaper, nothing about acquitting.

The law as a child

Only things repeated on radio are remembered. Ask people about public trials and they remember only two or three, but they started across tribunals right after October revolution. Public trials following 1918-1920. Indiscriminate accusations and collaboration of defense and prosecutors against accused. These are skipped by abridged version.

The law becomes a man

Describes law in Boy Scout stage in 1920s. Political code has unlimited scope.

The law matures

Special attention to 3 trials of late 1920/ with engineers and loyal communists under attack. 1934- violations of lenist legalist violated. The published record didn’t exactly match published records. Snag with assigned testimony and recess called to get him back on track(punishment maybe??). Dmitrivof Leninist guard and leaders came drenched in urine to courts. 1936-1938 had maybe as much experience of imprisonment of a collective farmer, 10 years. Not real interrogation. Most far sighted killed themselves. Put on public trial most compliant.

The supreme measure

Catherine never executed anymore through 7 years war. During 1905 45 month were executed, revolution. Banned. 1917 restated capital punishment for military, balsyics. 1918 had 1000 a month. New era of executions. Sinking  barrages unidentifiable people. Executed for trying to get some side hay. 1936 no record of executions. 1937, as reported by officers who were than arrested themselves, half million political prisoners shot. In a main building of GPU in a city, shot 200 a night. 1950 brought execution back for premeditated murder and terrorism in places of imprisonment(annoying prisoners), rape or bribery called temporary.

Tyurzak

Hunger strike is a moral move that requires guards to have souls. Hunger strikes won in 1915 being released from interrogation and getting better conditions. Before 1930, could get individual demands with hunger strikes. After 1930, they decided hunger strike was abolished and now illegal. After one went up to 20 days to get a parcel or a walk, was it worth prob not as strength in prison didn’t return. Prison guard had no newspaper 1) Patience 2) Deception(tell people they got what they want) 3) forced feeding 4) it was illegal and longer term. Declared people not responsible for death and doesn’t even count as days in jail for interrogators scores. No newspaper. Special purpose prisons for famous people or ringleaders like tyurzak. 1930 all grass and trees cut in prisons. 1920 had fresh food and always protein. Deteriorated fast. 30 and 40s rationed light to have perpetual darkness. Couldn’t read, maybe light at night preventing sleep. Not even allowed to look up during few walks outside. Letters could be sent twice a month. Only whisper. Walking around  could be considered rebellious for punishment cell. Punishment was according to a schedule(all prisoners should spend time there). 5 days in punishment cell and after 6 he didn’t complain as that would be considered unruly and more days in the cell. Released on 7thday.

Part 2 Perpetual Motion

The ships of the archipelago

All these islands and must be sent between with sealed train cars and ships. Well designed. Back of passenger trains in a sealed baggage car, no windows. Compartment of 4 for passengers becomes for 14. Prison train with half the train for guards. Very tight, up to 8 days. For what you can laying down, then throw in double the people. Barely touch floor sometimes. After one compartment of old women, all but 2  went to hospital. Feed smoked carp or salt herring (thirst) for whole trip. If your smart eat at next check point with water. “Nothing was issued for you to eat today “. Such a pain why get good water for the enemies of the people. Why not give them murky water they can’t see it in the dark. And if you give water they make the healthy drink first with the prison mugs then sick ordered. Then people want to go to the bathroom and the more the drink the more they go to the bathroom. 120 people would take 3 convey guards to prevent escape so much time. If you didn’t give water or food, they wouldn’t have to go the bathroom. Quite reasonable. Possessions are a waste of energy. The faster you decide to have nothing and you won’t return get used to living without loved ones.

The ports of the archipelago

Most prisoners remember 5 or experienced 50 of these ports. All so similar. Experience f with good memory know all these cities with their transit prisoners. All towns have transit prison. 6 level bunk beds with ladders weak prisoners had to climb. Latirene bucket is considered in media worst of gulag. But what a luxury, the real problem was when there was no bucket. There were some without buckets and often too small as prisons swelled with people and industry hadn’t caught up. 20x capacity with no bucket and only toilet once a day. Wisdom is pee in a boot. One bowl for food per 4 prisoners, one of them peeing in it then refusing to clean it with their water is lowest point of human being. Months like that Ron health for entire life. Russia wanted westerns to renounce west, brought some billionaires son and promised him capitalist rich life if he denounced his family and the west. He visited and saw some great country actors and pretty girls. He was gaged and brought to Moscow from Germany, but wouldn’t renounce so they couldn’t let him go so 20 years. All women naked walk in front of guards to select bedmates.

Chapter 3 Slave Caravan

Caravans red cattle cart train go straight to prisons. Sometimes on foot, so don’t overwhelm roads and railways. How they sent so many often in trains like this. Car prepared for prisoner by testing walls for strength, hole in floor, chain windows, searchlights, heightened fright cars for guards, and kitchens. Didn’t want to horrify public so only done at night every night. Searchlights to scare and tell to run for intimidation with police dogs barking so couldn’t talk. Convey spends entire day preparing. Counts, baths, core was general frisking to take everything that could be used to escape from straps to sharp. Naked prisoner goods thrown into barrel and guards and jailer take goodies. Every stop they searchlight room and tell you to run to either side with a slap on the ribs if your slow. Hit walls, left right and faster. Red train you might not disembark, some red trains deliver more corpses than living. Only find out who is alive or dead when they tell you to get up and leave sometimes. Once a 3 month journey or go nowhere stop somewhere to setup camp. False hope it’s better in camp.

From island to island

About traveling lone prisoners from camp to camp

Part 3: the destructive labor camps

The fingers of aurora

Concentration camps as early as 1921 surprised so many westerns, but of course that was. Marx teach old bourgeois need to break up old one and create new one of police, courts, and prison. First months after revolution Lenin already calling for “draconian measures”. Forced labor was considered just a few months after revolution. October revolution to 1959 calculated this cost 66 million lives. Before feb 1918, light penalties and Lenin called for 10yearw of prison and 10 years forced labor for bribery. Decrees in Aug and Sep 1918 Russian decrees used calling for concentration camps for enemy of state and “doubtful” (not guilty) ones. This was birth of term and first term used against own citizens. First concentration camps 1921 half pound of bread , half pound for those who fill norm, hot water for tea morning and evening, ladel of gruel in evening with dozen grains and potato peels in it. Special camps needed in north for more extreme as close to citizens and usually in old monasteries after throwing out monks. By end of 1920, 84 camps in 32 provinces with from official stats 25k prisoners and 24k pow, seems understated.

The archipelago rises from the sea

Throw out monks except useful ones from monastery cuz nice walls. Only children prison colony completely dressed. Many prisoners stayed in company in underwear. Cleaning infamy, but where to put them. Out in the snow for 3 hours then bring them back. Kill in daytime sends message, why just at night alone. New leader of this prison thought you must get everything out of them in the first 3 months then don’t need them. Every archipelago had to be encircled by hostile soviet sea scape, couldn’t intermingle with outside. Escapes increased, but on this actual island had actually cold oceans. Prisoners subtly rejoice during escapes. One man escaped and released book contradicting idea of it as a Russian paradise. Leading Russian writer would come and prisoners eagerly awaited. Clothed prisoners and sent distant labor parties, started up children education. June 20th 1929. Ship of prisoners in underwear and sacks when the Russian writer came to embark on that streamer. Where to put all these people, can’t drown or shoot too noisy and cleanup, barren island. Help him not notice he will try not to, Gathered everyone super close together sit down and threw tarp over them and said anyone who moves or talks will be shot. Writer spent a full hour here and he didn’t notice. No overcrowding obviously, and all the thieves were reading newspapers on benches. Thrives didn’t dare complain, but read newspaper upsidedown. Writer flipped newspaper for one, he had noticed he knows gay prisoners. Child 14 said everything  you see here is false and told hour long story of all the crazy torture and we don’t know his name. Writer June 23rd shot the boy after he left. Russian writer claimed it was nonsense and prisoners lived remarkably well there and great educatation and published everywhere.

The archipelago meta sizes

When Russia went to just for mass industrization but massive massive industrialization. Perspective on prison camps changed and unemployment abolished. 1930 started labor camps founding crewing out new camps with this perspective. Camps keep metasosing creatin new ones and transit and railways rose hundreds to connect them. Camp administrations, camp sectors, departments, more. Millions of wires of barbed wires and watch towers became commonplace in Russian scenery. Purpose is correction through labor, understood as destruction through labor. Frankel was merchant and became agent of black market to buy gold, was arrested but went letter to top and chief of economic section and made thesis of using up prisoner in first 3 months. Met Stalin and maybe proposed labor camps to create socialism and rewards for good work like time off and early release. White Sea Baltic Canal labor construction project is actually in history with books commissioned for/by gov about it, unlike the labor camps and guard towers strangely not showing up in movies or paintings despite dotting landscape across the country. History of book, 1933 white suited asked prisoner about his work and if he enjoyed it in front of chief. Most of glorified people in text were actually declared enemies of the people within two years and so books burned. They stated no one died during construction, maybe just looked at workers when it started and ended ignoring prisoner transport system. “Human raw material is immeasurably harder to work than wood”. Threw bodies at it, not supplies with barely any tools to move granite and chop trees. At end of day, corpses left on work site. Tried to break up families, no teaching. Some who gave all their heart in the work lost their strength faster even for tasks that would be impossible even in the summer.

Chapter 4 archipelago hardens

1933, central committee of communist party and great leaders decided “that the dying off of the state so firmly promised by Lenin and fervidly expected by humanists wouldn’t come by weakening the state but on the contrary through strengthening it to the upmost which was necessary in order to kill off the more .. classes”. So strengthening prison to strengthen state. So bottomless pit opened. Memos to reduce the number of prisoners, test machine gun fire, workers die in mass, every morning corpse collection. War shook camp. Some relaxed regime, not improve supplies. Others tightened. Special orders to hold onto prisoners and not allow releases.

Chapter 5 what the archipelago stands on

Economic requirements for camp with intersection with justification. Labor with no requirements of health, supplies, or families, great economically. Productive labor was the best way to reform not contemplation. Humane to help them and not just prison. “Retains feeling of dignity”. Serfdom basically. There are differences , most are worse for prisoners. Prisoner is night to night, serfs had holidays and worked during day and owned huts. Prisoners have full body searches and could be moved on demand. “In Russian no one ever died from starvation”, true until prisoners. 50% of all prisoners never returned to their family. To get normal prison ration for inactive prisoner, needed to be exemplary worker. Brigade, slave driver without much oversight. Two bosses, hammer and anvil, in competition to get more from prisoner and give less. Earnings with least cost.

Chapter 6 they bought the facists

This chapter tells of Czechs,58s are fascist prisoners in 1945 after Japanese surrender.

Chapter 7 the way of life and custom of the natives

So many ways to live with so many different labor. Logging is classic. Farming is best as you can get some yourself. Oh really cold days, would record it was the day off and then still send the prisoners out to get more work out of them. Dugouts and tents as barracks. Always take free belongings from camp to not lose them. Bare boards as beds. Often Koresene lamps. Insect lice bedbugs. Best study of dying alive and reducing humans to ash. Hunger darkens and focuses the mind. Can’t escape in dreams. Some had no doctors, so no sick just send them out to work with the party carrying them. If you bit into bread, that is scurvy and you will basically begin to rot you teeth fall out and Ulcers appear. Diarrhea skin peel, pallagra need herring or chalk to stop diarrhea. Weakness very fast. Live crawl on face, your dead. Early release is death. 1941 50k prisoners by 1942 10k. No record of prison transport. Don’t waste underwear on dead, remove before tossing corpse. Dig graves. No gas chambers, waste of gas.

Chapter 8 woman in camp

No harder or even easier. Not clear they become more deeply depressed. One guy said Woman react more swiftly and sharply to arrest and effect loss of family. In camp, everything was opposite being harder for woman. Filth was worse, could never bathe or feel clean. Woman inspected in showers like livestock. Started with Male trustees inspecting clothed, but eventually nude one by one walk then trustees decided who got whom. 1 woman per 6:7 men in 20s. Increases substantially as it goes. Pretty always prized. Trustees entered with best clothes and invited choices to visit them. Chosen woman feasted and more brazen asked for payment after potatoes others walked them back to compound explaining future of getting benefits of guard camp. Not everyone got offer. Everyone lives like that here so less condemning. Common to see Multiple bunks curtained off with rags. At one camp, one woman barracks of 500 and bunks not curtained off and happened in full view. Attractive woman had constant stream to her bunk, only ugliness and old age were defense. If there was a crane, labor would be taken out lose purpose. Labor causes Everything feminine even monthly  ceases. Shoulder sharp angle, breast hang down like dried out sacks, hoarse voice. 1944 free people could dissolve marriage of someone in prison for fee. More quickly forget family. Camp love stood out even though it was very difficult and if discovered would be split up. To give birth in camp means certain separation. Often defective baby cuz malnourished.

Chapter 9 the trustees

Trustees got by prison standards, soft jobs. Despised by other prisoners.

Chapter 10 In place of the political

Who to fight for prisoners, politicians taken in first wave. Why need political when you have reached equality. Children of 12 and on fully reasonable for crimes. 58 years for deaf man who hung his jacket on Lenin. 25 years for praying in church against Stalin, who would have heard it lol. Negative attitude towards stage loans or anything the state was declaring. Denunciation in lovers quarrel just shine a little light and they are gone.

Chapyer 11 the loyalists

Interrogators, prosecutors, and guards that got behind bars. Was most painful for them as guilty as nothing of all, taboo among them to ask what you got arrested for. Needed sense of their own righteous and couldn’t get consist world where they were innocent. 1937 was huge wave and most of people arrested. Central committee basically let each one be arrested. Some would even allow a position leading their own prison if the party just gave forgiveness.

Chapter 12 knock knock knock

Back then, almost only eyes and ears were school pigeons. Who is it among us? Impossible to dispel them, but you have to fake around them and recognize them. Ask someone with a light heart to write everyone with anti Soviet sentiments. You can’t, write everyone you guarantee with your life are true soviets. You can’t do that either ahahah you know they are anti Soviet.

Chapter 13 and your second skin too

Would give second terms while you were still in the camps. Philosophy seemed to be to kick those while they are down. War brought officerspushed  to front, needed to prove they were valuable by discovering huge plots against Soviet exploding 2nd terms in 1939 on.

Chapter 14 Changing ones fate

Can’t protest, but couldn’t but wish to escape. If your designated to die, why not run. Usually mostly at first year. 138 prisoners escaped March 1930 in ssr. Got new term if found escaping. How would you live on the outside, and those with best chance have advantages and those could be lost. One man 1942 escaped and was caught 17 years later, many cases

Chapter 15 punishment

If no further punishment to be applied, how could you enforce camp life??? Penalty cells. Cold damp starvation(winter russia) in underwear. Beat with felt boot with brick in it to not leave marks. Refusal to become informers.

Chapter 16 the socially friendly

1917 thieves thought as just factors of their environment and are anti property. Part of proletarians. But who taught who? Robbery of state just a few potatoes, 10 years then later upped to 20. Rob entire house, 6 months to a year. And if they are going to get out soon, you didn’t see them shouldn’t be witness. No one publicized murder. Decided malaria was solved and now impossible to treat or diagnose. Criminals aren’t capitalists, so these criminals are socially friendly crimes. Political prisoners can topple state. Thieves never had such power.

The kids chapter 17

Orphaned. Age of 12 and political prisoners allowed complete punishment from 1935, before was reduced sentences. 16-24 were 48% of prisoners in 1927. Probably who October population arrested 10 years ago. From 1940s allowed punishment if intentional. Grew into it with philosophy of archipelago, only might makes right. In days, these kids learned this deeply, adults had their past. 12 year old decided only those that don’t steal or lie are only afraid to. Create injustice yourself. Thieves United. Struggle against instructors and guards. Some kids ran to nurse and then collectively rapped her, couldn’t shoot them so couldn’t rescue until they let her go. Boys excited about women early and Never let go chance to let of stream. Schooling was fake, supposed to be 4 of work and 4 of schooling. Entered adulthood wanting to be with theif and undernourished. One of biggest sources of embarrassment was children stealing from you and their petty games. 1954 loosened children terms a little. One child arrested at 10 decided to never take her cross off her neck. Sent to restarted school as she wouldn’t submit. She shit in some statue head and got 10 years more in camp long after her parents were freed.

Chapte the muses in the gulag

Using artists and actor to re-educate

Chapter 20 the zeks as a nation

Descrbes the zeks as if they were their own nation.

The dogs service

Dogs fed better than prisoner and need good viciousness. This is about Prison keepers and chiefs of the gulag. Corneal down . Can camp keeper be good human being? MVBD training is first selection if anyone has sense of good and evil they back out. Second is when bosses filter out those who are strong”/merciless. Third is on the job and not staying in. With this selection, often similar. They have arrogance and since no one can question them they must be amazing at their job. Thought they were proletariat with their nice estate. Autocracy and orders. Sense of possessing they own estate and camp. Greed and money grubbing. Since power was not forever like serfs, they sought to steal for themselves as much  as they could. Camp harem, one had each nice young women brought to him on arrival. Conclusion can’t be decent person. Every prisoner once found human jailer, never an officer or above.

21 campside

Each island had zone of stink around it and ideology of camp life gets to Soviet Union. The prison guards , jailers, recently freed zeks, free people chasing good labor, lived here.

22 we are building

Was it profitable for state? Great topic. If you believe congress then it is useful for criminals, and good for society. Often first construction project planned than prison recruitment. Prisoners were great complex supporting gov machine. Zeks needed for the work where no one would want to work and so difficult no one wouldn’t want to do. How could they not be profitable? But wasn’t and couldn’t. The first and principle cause is lack of conscientious of prisoners, looked to break anything to sit down for a moment. And free employees don’t care either. Need entire prisoner apparatus and fence and conveys.

Part 4 soul in the barbed wire

Chapter 1 the ascent

365 days of alien work with idle mind and think. Draw some conclusions from the misfortune. Criminal to have conscious and repent and think. Only a few actually steal and proud of it. What were vast majority supposed to repent for. Could bring in any free person at all, not guilt but disaster. Astounding rarity of suicide, much more escapes than suicide. Perhaps fewer suicides in camp than freedom. Condemned to waste away from starvation and labor, this meant some invincible feeling . Their universal innocence. So if not repent , what do you think of. Black storms as I center of world was arrested. How could we not have seen those that report us, must be corrected. But can’t, now recall their past and unused opportunities. Day of release must be reached. Survive at any price. Great fork of camp life. Right you lose your life, left you lose your conscious. Price is often someone else, not majority that turned right but many. Some transformation also to become more spiritual, darkness creates thirst for life, if you love life, camp life is also life. No meetings or control of your thoughts, freedom of your mind no leaders or social status or propaganda. No one can deprive you of your family and possessions as always lost. “Result is what counts” core ideas of Russia. How could someone with Two country homes and good life want anything more? It’s not results, but at what price that counts. How? While you are alive, live proudly and become most dangerous character because what hold do they have on you. You are ascending. Armor covers heart, rule of life is do not rejoice when you have found or weep when you have lost. Love those close in spirit in slavery and in blood. One guy thought If you go through your life, you will find what you did wrong and punishment is for what you deserve. But understand in the end why you ended up in prison and what you could have done better. He looked back that he was misdirected in his life. He thought he was infallible, but only there in prison did he feel  good. “That the line separating good and evil passes not through states or classes or political parties, but right through every human heart and through all human hearts”. Even the best of heart have Evil and the worst of hearts have good. Can’t be dispelled only contained. Nuremberg trial insulted very idea of evil not just so called evil doers. Know your own errors and mistakes. He sometimes turns back, “thank you prison for having been in my life”. Though he came out alive.

Chapter 2 or corruption?

Some will say it was not ascend they ever saw but corruption. Honesty and pride fell away from us and leaving only angry. Camp is worse than prison as camp corrupts while prison ennobled.  Camp is a competition with bread limited, vain calculations required. Hate labor and companions. How could you ascend? “The more you spit on people, the more they esteem you”. Become the bird so fast. Fastest corruption is enlistment of prisoner in guards even more sever than free guards. Zeks were the transport, security, and interrogation chiefs in 1930s. This is the general trend, much more surprising the ones who survived in the cold and stayed their faith. Nuns kept with prostitutes, believers often died but not corrupted. Some had honesty so monster unnatural wouldn’t steal or lie and often punished for it. Didn’t steal when everyone else did. Those without religious often became corrupted in camp especially if they were corrupted in freedom. Camp corruption so often not just because camps horrible but Soviet people were corrupted from early age and intended to corrupt. There is no corruption without ascent.

Chapter 3 our muzzled freedom

Author had tumor in his stomach. Archipelago made up 8% of country and released poisons to rest of body. 30,40, and 50s did have truth so it could not have real literature.1)  Constant fear across the country with only one careless word. All inhabitants hung over the chasm of the atchipelgo. They took, left out only understood in one context, 2) servitude . no one could quit work of their own accord. 3) secret and mistrust. Absolutely necessary, didn’t tell wife anything. Wife would just say her husband left her instead of arrested. Didn’t inform one another. 4) universal ignorance. With no trust didn’t learn from one another, completely relied on media. 5) squealing was mind boggling extent, stool pigeons with enormous numbers to make each person feel presence. 1/4 or5 had proposal to be recruited. Weakens ties and any still pigeons would want regime to continue. Least dangerous form of life was constant betrayal of ignoring others misfortune . Hostile to anyone you knew who became an “enemy” and reject family of “enemy” vividly at work even if they were your friend. Safer to house dynamite than orphans of enemies. All those that were pure, were first to go making society worse. Souls thoroughly muddied and Soviet citizens were the ones denouncing others and agreeing to be still pigeon. Ready made lies and cliches. No man who has typed or spoken in mic without lying. Every conversation with anyone called for lies. Do you start child off on lies or tell them the truth and hope they don’t slip up. 9) cruelty. Mercy and kindness ridiculed. 10) slave society. Setting dogs onto people only statue in a town.

4 individual stories, skipped by editor

Part V katorga

Siberia of katorga, shackles, into Soviet; socialist Siberia. - Stalin

Chapter 1 the doomed

Katorga, good word that means hard labor and penal servitude. Stalin liked old words even when feb revolution abolished it. Stalin reestablishes kt 26 years after. Undisguised murder camps so they could put in a little work. Bunk beds for 80 kept 200 in. 12 hour working day with no days off so 100 at work and 100 in hut all the time. Tommy gun fire for no good reason for fun, no other prisoner dragged themselves so hopelessly could see them. Part of 12 hours rest was travel and searched, food, inspection. Bucket and hatch with nothing else. 4 for actual undisturbed sleep. Traitors usually, or women that slept with occupying soldiers. Teachers or local administration when occupied was punished. Did Russia ever have such masses of traitors especially when it was this supremely just order? Never so much in all Russian history of 11 centuries, so why? Usually people who had lost many people themselves in 20s and 30s, or craftsmen who couldn’t do their trade or snipped wheat from gov to eat. If error, it must be post. Communists jailed communists. 2 months left a third of population to enemy. Forget and join the homeland fight. Should we be surprised so many welcomed Germans without fear of crazy arrests now. Discover mass graves with thousands of corpses in a single town. Many saw entire life and newspaper as one long lie. Doctrine of Lenin says oppressed class that isn’t willing to learn and take up arms will revive nothing but slavery. So appreciate how many villages during war wanted freedom. Hopefully this new American army would defend real freedom, some chased retreating German army better than staying under Soviet.

Chapter 2 the first whiff of revolution

Editor notes: Russia Ukraine relations. Increasing spirit of resistance among prisoners

Chapter 3 chains chains

Wind of change only in transit prisons. Handcuffs went into mass production 30s year after October revolution. Could be very tight and greater pain crushed wrists. 4 fingers in handcuffs. Hands became swollen and numb and men cried. Bought from nazis the idea of numbers instead of name. Number before names, were afraid to get rid of names as number could be blown away. 4 years after numberg trials. Numbers, mark of satan, hated by religious women. Guards actually capitulated to these women demands and let them not have numbers.

Chapter 4 why did we stand for it

Russia is history of tyranny. After Napoleon, 7 attempts made on Alexander life. Execute thousands, create fear, no that was unthinkable back then. So few political prisoners back then, tsarian gov obviously so feeble in comparison. Lenin brother executed for attempt of life on Alexander the third, Lenin went to great university and expelled for organizing student demonstration against gov. He would have been shot today, just expelled and then allowed to practice law and take law exams. Founded league of struggle in city, wasn’t imprisoned or torture. No just arrested and allowed dozens of books and conditions for intellectual write greater part of economic essays in real journals. Sent in food to prison himself and trotsky also wrote in prison. Travel to new prison as a freeman for a week, exiled allowed to travel with free man. Political exile book allowed to be in print. Banished and only wrote things for fame, and allowed to return just not to capital. Police just put him away for 3 weeks, not 20 years hard labor like now. Undercover thugswhen he organized resistance, no relatives punished. Family legally gave Lenin money from within Russia. In these conditions, Lenin decided political freedom wasnt important but moral foundations of society. Maybe in the long run, but not the first step. Defeat of tsarian was not when they went down but once Russian literature that idolized gov or cops were hated. Public opinion is how prisoners can do anything or strikes and protests just punished. End of 1800s corporal punishment new for political punishments, prisoners committed suicided 13 and the opinion caused corporal punishment to be banned forever. But now, no news leaks out. Tsarian escapes coordinated with those outside. Success now depends too much on outside. So why did they put up with it, they didn’t at all. in special camps, raised banner of politicals and political they became.

Chapter 5 poetry under a tombstone,

Author instead of becoming trustee like educated  often did, instead sought a trade. Was smaller for a while. Rocky bottom hit. Wrote a poem in his mind. Memory could be done. One a month went through entire poem counting with match sticks. Used rosary beads to remember poem. 12k lines. Allowed to keep for prayer. A few others write as well. Some philosophers and theologians had to rediscover in isolation. “Soul must suffer first to know bliss of paradise” God wanted to feel suffering by sending Jesus. 1948 several Baptists sentences just because Baptists, strong willed.

Chapter 6 the committed escaper

One who never doubts that man can’t leave behind bars. Spends every thinking hour and action to escaping. Knows risk and sees those failed that die. Not undermined by others or other types of struggle. Only escape. Freedom. Vague hopes of leniency and a mistake kept you from trying. Bar he broke off and hide in his jacket and practice drawing it and striking interrogator.collect stories of escape attempts. Need to know land and we’re to go. Get guards used to absence, need night head start. Are you are ready to die you are ready to escape. Stale sentry always makes escape easier, late in shift.

Chapter 7 the white kitten

Continues escape and remain on loose for a month scouring for water and food and sometimes stealin. Eventually captured and given long sentence.

Chapter 8 escapes and morales

Escapes seen by leaders as operational cost. In special camps, greatly reinforced defense like spy escapes. Longer sentences increased escapes. Stole cow from a village and when caught villagers want to straight shoot them. But, when they were found to be political prisoners the villages changed their attitude and bought them food and water saying they should have asked for help.

Chapter 9 kids with tomboys

Worst were kids who never saw war and grew up in this world. Duty to shoot of out of line these disgusting people. Didn’t know prisoners or why they were there, any attempt to learn was breach of oath ignorance. One convey guard thought prisoners just slept all day and reinforced it. Rewarded for killing, showed vigilance.

Chapter 10 behind the wire the ground is burning

Surprising with all this there were such uprising and escapes. Legendary story in 1941 in public works site 501. Corrective labor camp within recent soldiers. Team killed convey guards and free next camp and next camp. Tried to take next camp but paratroopers and planes stopped them and extended everyone in the entire camps sentence. Bold desperate thought went through camp and the age of escape was over and the age of rebellion had begun. Kill stools pigeons and murder became normal. Dozen killed by 5 thousand, free because stool pigeons feared and you can say what you want. Foreman starting fleeing and information machine broke down. Author can say now in his nice room violence will just lead to more. And if you saw someone kill, obviously you knew nothing. No one saw anything. One day someone came to prison bed to come with them, and he said I’m not going and the other prisoners said don’t take him go away. And now to grab someone you need tricky.

Chapter 11 tearing at the chain

This blow meant more would change. Labor strike now, can’t affect outside . Stoolies now torturing prisoners to find out the killers. Find your murders yourself. Random killing trying to scare stoolie. Some heard fire and stayed inside others took it as signal to see what it was about. 3k men understanding now was the time went on labor and hunger strike. He was a foreman at that time and when they called to eat, no one came. They just did nothing for 3 days. Men in separate barracks went together. Didn’t expect any concession, but something beautiful about hopelessness and community. A fuck you. Summoned foreman to front and said the administration requests the prisoner take their food and will look over complaints between administration and prisoners. Prisoners crowded at door and the ones in the back could yell the real demands. Never had their bosses speak like that, and no one could promise decision and team decided. What else could they hope for, but trust the word? Hut 9 surrendered and author cried. Now an old man said he won’t go supper and wouldn’t get up as everyone went to eat. Atmosphere changed forever and foreman(zek position) never would punish prisoner because how easy to make knives and politics discussed freely. Leader would barely know. Special camps began crisis in beginning of 50s.

Chapter 12 the forty days of Kengir

To show the prison camps were important and salaries and resources shouldn’t be reduced. More unrest and random fire to show these camps were dangerous. Camps would join strike even if many had 10ers and were nearing end of sentence. Labor strikes when random killings asking for guard to prosecuted. Special camps  were political prisoners so did nothing wrong, brought in thieves now thinking they would resort order by turning prisoner against each other. Biggest mutiny in history of gulag. Politics had to offer thieves a war or alliance. Impossible for alliance to not be accepted. And impossible for alliance not to be used. Obvious should get food stores first. What do they want, murders punished, locks and numbers off huts. Delegation from Moscow came and thought demands were reasonable. Believed because easiest to believe always want hope. The next day after work, jailers hurried prisoners to not know what was happening and calls for rebellion sent jailers running from camp but walls guarded. Burrow under camp walls to unite them. Had government elected for 30 days. Wives saw husband for first time, religious could practice. Generals entered given search and could negotiate. Freedom freedom, said they could desert at any time and prisoners said yes leave if you want to. Few did they would stay United. Defend breaches with pikes and built walls. Said they demands were met Then tanks rolled in hardcore that night. General seen putting knives in prisoner hands to get dead gangsters pictures. Group of prisoners searched and laid down and guards would pull out those they saw from guard towers.

Part 6 Exile

Chapter 1 exile in the first years of freedom

Exiled often in Russia, go by yourself among strangers. Inactivity. Early 20 exiles were often, even though just killing them was easier sometimes. Lenin got a maintenance salary allowing him to be idle. 1929 no food given or anything, often they would just stay in exile location, homesickness less important.

Chapter 2 the peasant plague

15M starved. 6M famine brought by boshiveks. 1929 started. Liquiding kulaks as a class from central committee. Smith with a few unused acres assessed crazy tax and when they couldn’t pay they were bloodsuckers to the gulag. Brick houses in row of log cabins. 15 families needed one. Point was not to get rid of kulak.  Better off people often left alone, peasants who failed to comply gulag. Purpose to force peasants into collective farms. Some kulaks didn’t even have food for the journey to gulag. Entire town became transport prison, and you couldn’t help them walking around town if they were starving or dead or your passport would be taken. One village fled into forest and hid for 20 years

Chapter 3 the ranks of exile thicken

20s exile was waystage to camps. 30s grew with type of camp. Exile was great for cleansing of people. 40s had so many from occupied and western countries. Why exile? Criminal nationality, previous term in camp, or resident in seditious area.

Chapter 4 nations in exile

1937 10ks of Koreans just relocated swiftly. Just a test. July 1941 so easy, just use nationality, bulga Germans exiled whole people. Then used quite often, armed divisions just enter and all proper have 12 hours to get ready to leave. No exceptions and everyone goes together no fight. Sure law exile can’t be done if under 16 , but just special settlers. Leave entire house and possessions. Kazaidrsn and Siberia a favorite. Kazekidtan had half population from this.

Chapter 5 end of sentence

Author dreamed of exile instead, he didn’t know it I’d rarely instead of. You can get both. Laurie waits for you and fetched. Exile after often. Awe at woman in village. After a night, exile got private lodging and had to pay for everything. The next day, Stalin had died 1953.

Chapter 6 good life in exile

Author life in Kazakhstan reading and writing and such.

Chapter 7 zeks at liberty

Released is like another arrest or abrupt transition. Can’t get good job or residency permit at least inside you got rations. Often sudden tension release often some died on release or got sick. Not freedom of movement. Or sudden thirst for life and appreciation, superstitious aversion to owning things. Author each year, zek day eats a little bread and very quickly picks at crumbs like old ways. Community of millions. Not often reunion go well, 10 years often too much difference between wives and children.

part 7 Stalin is no more

Chapter 1 looking back at it all

He was lucky enough to get some truth through to the mass and didn’t believe he the prisoner story would actually be told in their life. Many letters he got for his first story. Breakthrough of wall of lies. Even today’s archipelago, the new guy said that was Stalin, but zeks in scrawled paper were like we are still here.

Chapter 2 rulers change but archipelago remains

Special camps removed numbers and bars. Prisoner could get Soviet cash, wear hair, even correspond and visit now. 1954-56, unprecedented time of indulgences. 1961 decree against stoolie murders and clamped back in chersuvs camps. Differ not in regime but population still millions but not 58s. Regime needs the archipelago.

Chapter 3 law today

All those millions of criminals you saw, not politicals. Whole town rebelled and stamped out, June 2nd 1962. Turning point in Russian history. Haphazard thrown together from soul of people and two decrees came and they just started protesting stopping trains. One officer committed suicide, story is he heard to order to fire on square. 80 died and the citizens kept coming back to square. First warning volley hit kids in the tree. Family wounded and dead just deported to Siberia. Now provocations and bullets were from enemies of the state and they would be found. Extra religious prosecution. Not even open trials anymore, semi public with extra shenanigans. Judges only look on fake evidence on preliminary investigation, even if they denounce it in church. 197 baptists in a town got 5 years in. CAmp or exile mostly cuz baptists. This chapter should be called there is no law.

Afterword

He wanted to have coauthors, but instead he got anecdotes. Had to separate book into parts and hide creation. 1967.
