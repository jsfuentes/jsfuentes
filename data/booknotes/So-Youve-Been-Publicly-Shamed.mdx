title: 'So You''ve Been Publicly Shamed'
---

#Book by [[Jon Ronson]]
- We all hold a terror that we will be found out. That one day we will blurt out something stupid that will make everyone realize we are a [[Fraud]]
- Every since I've learned about [[Confirmation Bias]] I've been seeing it everywhere so it must be true
- Jonah Laire the book writer that was outed by the small time journalist
- Going to Africa, hope I don't get aids jk I'm white girl
- Swinger who did it with journalists and killed themselves when published as warned
- [[Stanford Prison Experiment]], one guard went wild and later said he was just pretending and all the media around it is overblown
- Hitler sex tape released and guy emerged strongly by not showing shame and going on tv and saying you shouldn't be judged for that and sued journal for saying it was Nazi-themed. Maybe [[Sex]] acts aren't shameful anymore though, being racist or sexist is where the real shame is thrown these days
- Girl who disrespect military memorial
- These people didnt even do anything wrong
- [[Shame]] is a main driver of violence, to be respected just for a moment
- Give prisoners dignity to change their cycle of abuse can be helpful, but should we give them more forgiveness then we give each other(people who did atrocious things)
