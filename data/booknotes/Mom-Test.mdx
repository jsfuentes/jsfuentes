#Book by [[Rob Fitzpatrick]]
- Summary:
    - Before:
        - What do we want to learn from these guys
        - Choose focused who where segment that gives consistent answers
        - Decide on 3 learning goals
        - Create beliefs for segment 
        - Look up anything you can
    - Asking:
        - Vision, framing, weakness, pedestal, ask
    - During: 
        - First, figure out if they have problem and start broad. => Demographics, what are your top problems? What are your biggest focuses or goals right now, what are you working on improving and spending time on?
            - Followup on surprising or emotional answers
            - If no mention of what you care about, then ask leading question like "is x on your list", but then reanchor with facts of their time or past on it
        - Never mention idea, try to convince, talk too much, or feel complimented
        - If they say:
            - Generic statement, fluff => Anchor with specifics like "When was the last time?"
            - Compliment, future promise => Deflect, apologize, and reask specifics. => How are you doing that now? What are the implications of that? What else have you tried?
        - Always end with who should I talk to or other commitments
    - After
        - Review these book because you didn't do it perfectly
- Intro
    - How to discover the truth when everyone is lying to you. Practical how to. Written by introverted person not sales people to sales.
- Chapter 1: Failing The Mom Test
    - Rule 1: Talk about their life instead of your idea. 
        - Can't lie to you if you never mention your idea.
        - If you put your ego on the line, your mom will rationalizes the purchase decision outside of real life. And then makes a feature request to pretend to be engaged.
        - It can actually be worse than not talking because you go with fist full of false positives.
    - Rule 2: Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.
        - Instead of hypothetical, ask what they did last time
        - Questions your mom can't lie to you in
    - Rule 3: Talk less and listen more 
        - don't pitch
    - Customer conversations are bad by default. Its your job to fix them.
        - Opinions are worthless.
        - People will lie to you if they think its what they want to hear.
        - People know what their problems are but they don't know how to solve them. Understand their goals
        - Some problems people complain about don't actually matter
        - Watching tasks will show you where the real problems are.
        - It’s easy to get someone emotional about a problem if you lead them there.
        - If they haven't googled it, they aren't going to look for or buy yours.
    - Problematic Statements:
        - “Oh man, that happens all the time. I would definitely pay for something which solved that problem.”  => future promise statement
        - "Feature Request" => Feigns engagement. Why do they want that?
        - "I love it"
    - Questions
        - Good Questions:
            - Why do you bother? Good, goes from percieved problem to real problem
            - Wow that seems hard, why do you even do that? Great
            - What are the implications of that? Good, some problems don't matter
            - Why does that matter? Great pricing signal
            - Talk me through the last time that happened. Good. 
            - What else have you tried? 
                - What are they using now? How much does it cost and what do they love and hate about it? How much would those fixes be worth and how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution?
                - If they haven't even googled it, is it really a horrible problem
            - How are you dealing with it now? Great for pricing
            - Where does the money come from? Find budget owner
            - Who else should I talk to? End every conversation with this. You learn it's a bad conversation or they don't care.
            - Is there anything I should have asked you? Kinda a crutch but useful. People want to help you
        - Ok Questions:
            - What would your dream product do? Ok question, value is from followup asking why they want that. Motivation and reasoning. Don't put your ego on the table. People know what their problems are, but not how to solve them and how it's your job.
        - Bad Questions:
            - Do you think it's a good idea? Bad question, market question. Opinions are worthless
            - Would you buy something x? Hypothetical, answer almost always yes. Ask they how they currently do x, or why they haven't tried to solve it.
            - How much would you pay for x? Exactly like last one, expect feels more real cuz number
            - Would you pay x for product that does y? They want to make you happy. Bad, best to all the to pay you now.
    - Price based on value to them not cost too you.
    - Don't ask what you should build. You aren't allowed to tell people what their problems are and they aren't allowed to tell you what to build.
- Chapter 2: Avoiding Bad Data
    - Three types of Bad data: 
        - fluff(generics, opinions, hypotheticals, and the future)
            - Three Types of Fluff
                - Generic Claims: "I usually", "I always", "I never"
                - Future-tense promises: "I would", "I will"
                - Hypothetical maybes: "I might", "I could"
            - Examples of fluff
                - Deadliest fluff is "I would definitely buy that"
                - Bad combo: I hate x. I make x would ever use it? Hell yea I would use something like that. 
                - Fluff, empty promises, and ego on the line.
            - Questions avoiding fluff
                - Do you ever x?(fluff transition) when the last time? (Good setup) 
                - When was the last time this was a huge problem?
                - Better convo: When people are flaky, just say do it now. If x is problem, have you ever looked to solve x. Try one. Most people don't... Better data is I did use X, but I need so many apps etc.
        - ideas/feature request
            - Always dig deeper and see why they want that
                - How that would that fit into your day? 
                - Why do you want that? 
                - How are you coping without that now?
                - Why havent you been able to fix this already?
            - See if it's a buying criteria that they are actively searching for, know it's costing them money, or cobble together work around. Or would it just be nice to have
        - compliments
            - Sources
                - The Pathos Problem - When you seek approval and expose your ego, by telling them an idea you obviously care about
                    - "I can take it tell me what you think"
                    - "I really think X, ..."
                - Pitching - is demanding compliemnts by being annoying
                    - But,... 
                - You need to justify the meeting
                    - Tell them grand problem or vision or say you will give them a demo of vague space without biasing them with details. Like I'm working on improving child education. 
            - Signs
                - If you think everyone loved your product you are doing this wrong. 
                - Anytime you receive the compliment get incredible suspicious, that you did it wrong
            - Most meetings end with compliments, need to deflect to gather the real thing
            - Notice and deflect the compliments. 
            - Only get opinions from industry experts. If your later stage ask if you can show product, goal is to get to the truth but not to get them to care. 
            - Compliments feel like data, and if you find yourself saying everyone loves it or thanks. You need specific facts and commitment.
    - Dig into emotion. Embarrassed, angry. 
        - "Its the worst part of my day" => Always followup
        - Tell me more about that. 
        - I bet there's a story here. 
        - Is this a big deal. 
        - Go on. What else? 
        - People love talking, simple works
    - Don't interrupt and talk
        - You will be hugely tempted to interrupt and fix their understanding if you know what their gonna say or thought a lot about it
        - Losing the view from their mental model is bad.
        - "Oh its like X ", dont correct let them explain
- Chapter 3: Asking Important Questions
    - You should always ask the question whose answer would change your business. 
        - You should be terrified, but you need to learn to love bad news.
        - Imagine that the company had failed and ask why that happened
        - Imagine company as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there
        - What would you have someone else do if you were delegating
        - For example, questionable legality and support from customers means you should find some lawyers
    - Lukewarm responses are some of the most informative and best annswers
        - Don't try to convince them then hear about why.
        - Lukewarm is bad for sales, but great for learning if you should invest your time into it
        - "Umm, im not sure about that"
        - "Neat"
        - Followup to understand apathy:
            - Are they different from the ideal customer?
            - Is the problem not actually that big of a deal?
            - Do they get too many pitches in the same space?
    - Don't just zoom into their problem, look at their lives
        - Most people have lots of problems they don't actually care about
        - Don't ask about their problems with X, before figuring out if they care
            - Like asking someone how they stay fit is prematurely zooming in
                - Do they go to the gym? No, why not? 
                    - Well because you asked they will come up with an answer, but really they just don't care it's not in their life at all. 
                    - They might say convenience, but why don't they just do it at home. 
                - The whole conversation was made up, but you got them to rank criteria and say why they don't go to the gym veryyy misleading. 
            - First ask what they priorities are and if your problem makes it on that list
                -  If not, then the conversation won't be helpful find someone who does. 
                - Start the conversation wondering if they even care, you can safely assume small business care about marketing and marketers care about marketing
    - Does the problem matter questions
        - How seriously do you take your blog?
        - Do you make money from it?
        - Have you tried making more money from it?
        - How much time do you spend on it each week?
        - Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?
        - Which tools and services do you use for it?
        - What are you already doing to improve this?
        - What are the 3 big things your trying to fix or improve right now?
    - Look at the elephants
        - Good ideas need someone with a problem AND the capacity to pay. Startups have multiple failure points
    - Product Risk
        - Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it?
        - Would you want more customers => would you want more money. Questions like this are always yes and people would be excited. 
            - Would you want more customers = would you want more money. Questions like this are always yes and people would be excited. 
            - Its like an ad network, people will pay for views and affiliate marketing always.
    - Customer/market risk
        - B2B software can basically be proven through conversations, will they adopt product. 
        - Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of them?
    - Video games are mix where talking to people doesn't matter. 
    - Prepare your list of 3 most important things to learn
        - Move on when you learn and keep filling in the picture from multiple customers
        - Let's you ask one question when you run into dream customers
- Chapter 4 keeping it casual
    - One guy suggests three separate meetings. 
        - First on customers and problem, second on your product, this on sales. 
        - But huge time commitment. 
        - When your good and build credibility, people take meetings just to talk problem. But by then, 3 meetings is a great use of time.
    - Try to start with friends
    - Quick, casual chats better than long, formal meeting
        - Could go to meetup and drop the most important questions could as valuable as several customer interviews
        - If we do it right, they wont even know we are talking about our idea
    - Don't just relegate everything to a meeting. 
        - Being too formal is a crutch, be a person from your industry. If it feels like they are doing you a favor, too formal.
        - If you see your dream girl in a coffee shop, no need to walk over and ask for a date you are basically already on a date i.e getting to know each other
        - “X seems really annoying, how do you deal with it?” “Is Y as bad as it seems?” “You guys did a great job with Z… Where did you get that from?”
    - At their best, these conversations are a pleasure for both parties. Your one of the first people in while to be interested in the petty annoyances of their day
    - If it feels like they are doing you a favor by talking to you, its probably too formal
    - Meeting length
        - Early conversations are very fast. Chats grow longer as you go towards specific products and industry issues
        - 5 mins to know whether problem exists and is important
        - 10-15 minutes for current workflows, but people love telling stories
        - Details of industry takes hour or more
        - 30 minutes cuz 15 minute chunks prob. 
    - Faster even if its casual as don't need formalities and intros and scheduling
- Chapter 5 Commitment and Advancement
    - When you have a product, can start showing product and asking for  commitments and advancement not compliments.
        - Commitments - Need they to sacrifice reputation with intro, money with commitments, or their time with trial or next meeting. Paid trials are all 3!
        - Advancement - Need to pop the next step and get closer to a sale
        - Go hand in hand as commitment (intro to boss, money) is often next step
    - Symptoms:
        - A pipeline of zombie leads that will take meetings but not buy
        - Ending product meetings with compliment
        - Ending wiht no clear next steps
        - Meetings which "went well"
        - They haven't given up anything of value
    - Example Endings
        - Bad meeting
            - "Thats so cool. I love it" 
                - Zero data, fluff
            - "Looks great. Let me know when it launches" Compliment plus a stalling tactic, classic. Polite "don't call me, I'll call you" 
                - Push for intro to others in team to make sure you built right product or alpha user
            - "I would definitely buy that"
                - Some signal, but high false positive danger. Get concrete current commitments. LOI, prepurchase, deposit, or intros
        - Ok meeting
            - "There are a couple people I can introduce you to when you're ready"
                - Nearly a good meeting, right now its bad. Doesn't hate you or he wouldn't have made fluff offer, but worthless signal. The more specific the more serious you can take it. Why can't he make the offer now? 
        - Good meeting
            - "What are the next steps?
            - Can I buy the prototype?
            - When can you come back to talk to the rest of the team?
            - "When can we start a trial?"
                - Maybe good, step forward. Business case is very valuable as usually training and setup involved, consumers usually almost free. 
    - Meetings don't "go well", they either succeed or fail.
        - Stalling tactics or compliments are nothing
        - "Let's talk again after the holidays...", "Don't call me, I'll call you"
    - Always think in terms of what they are giving up and push for a commitment to figure out whether they care
    - It's not a real customer or prospect until you have given them the chance to reject you. Goal early is learning and revenue is a side effect.
    - Even in more sales meeting, you want to start with open ended learnings to get your bearings and how this particular person fits into it. Learn with the mom test then confirm by selling it
    - First customers, earlyvangelists, in B2B saas 
        - Criteria:
            - Have the problem
            - know they have the problem
            - have the budget to solve the problem
            - have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution
        - Search for those emotional about the problem and keep them close they are precious, others arent first customers but keep them on the list
- Chp 5 Finding conversations
    - Hopefully you know people to talk to
    - Goal of cold calls is to stop having them
        - Treat people respectfully and genuinely care to try to snowball into warm intros
        - Even 2% is fine conversion
    - Don't be too formal, just find good excuse to talk to people even in person. Only thing people love more than talking about themselves is 
    - Don't try to pitch, idea never needs to enter equation.
    - How can you make people want to talk to you?
        - Immerse yourself in where they are and hang out and become them 
        - Landing pages work, while the metrics might not be the most signal can be great to email these people for a conversation. 
        - Organize a meetup, people will assume your credible as an organizer. Literally unfair and bootstraps credibility
        - Blog about the industry, even sending an email mentioning your blog can give you credibility. Metrics of blog irrelevant.
        - One guy wanted to hear about problems about  universities, so he emailed top schools like Harvard's etc saying the other two were gonna do a conference call about topic. They all agree wanting to learn from each other and other schools could listen in. Genius.
    - Creating warm intros, the best kind
        - Just ask. You can find whoever you need. 
        - Industry advisors can be a goldmine of intros and given 1/2% of equity just be met with once a month. You would be surprised how many people you can get to join your advisory board.
        - Professors are goldmine of intros. The people they know often are early adopters. 
        - Cash in all those favors of investors who said they wanted to help. 
    - Framing the meeting
        - If you don't know why you're there, it becomes a sales meeting by default and attention shifts to you with customers closing up about pricing
            - Symptoms:
                - "Um. So...."
                - "How's it going?"
                - Can I interview you? Thanks for agreeing to this interview
                    - Set off alarm bells that this is going to be super boring. People don't want to be interviewed, they want to talk and help.
                - Can I get your opinion on what we are doing?
                    - Sets expectations of neediness and that you want compliments
                - Do you have time for a quick X?
                    - Liable to waste time
        - Framing with 5 elements:
            - Vision - Best to say your a entrepreneur solving problem X to usher in wonderful vision Y or fix stagnat industry Z. Don't mention idea.
            - Framing - Mention what stage you are at and if its true, that you have nothing to sell them
            - Weakness - Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your specific problem that you're looking for answers on to clarify you're not wasting time.
            - Pedestal - Put them on pedestal by showing how much they, in particular can help
            - Ask - Ask for help
            - Very Few Wizards Properly Ask [for help]
        - Examples
            - 1
                - “Hey Pete, 
                - I'm trying to make desk & office rental less of a pain for new businesses (vision). We're just starting out and don't have anything to sell, but want to make sure we're building something that actually helps (framing). 
                - I've only ever come at it from the tenant's side and I'm having a hard time understanding how it all works from the landlord's perspective (weakness). You've been renting out desks for a while and could really help me cut through the fog (pedestal). 
                - Do you have time in the next couple weeks to meet up for a chat? (ask)”
            - 2
                - “Hey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and ultimately effective (vision). 
                - We're having a load of trouble figuring out how all the pieces of the industry fit together and where we can best fit into it (weakness). You know more about this industry than anyone and could really save us from a ton of mistakes (pedestal). 
                - We're funded and have a couple products out already, but this is in no way a sales meeting -- we're just moving into a new area and could really use some of your expertise (framing). 
                - Can you spare a bit of time in the next week to help point us in the right direction over a coffee? (ask)”
                - Excerpt From: Rob Fitzpatrick. “The Mom Test: how to talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everybody is lying to you.” Apple Books. 
        - This framework tells people they will be able to make a real difference
        - Control the reins of the meeting at the start so it doesn't devolve. Just repeat your email basically then jump into the first question
        - Do your homework and know what you want to learn.
    - Commute vs Call
        - In person is better, less formal, less time constraints, no body language, put in-between other meetings, more likely to be as friends
        - Nobody becomes friends over the phone so less warm intros.
    - Don't go in looking for customers, pretend your looking for an advisor
        - Makes you evaluate them now
    - How many conversations should you have?
        - If B2B, more conversations is valuable as they become sales leads
        - Try to talk until you keep hearing the same thing. 
        - If more than 10 without consistency, your customer segment is too fuzzy. 
        - You should be answer any customer question within a week
- Chp7 choosing your customer
    - Startups don't starve they drown
        - You never have too few options, too few leads, or too few ideas. 
    - Customer segmentation is important
        - Though it may seem like Google is for anything and Evernote backs up all notes. Start small
            - Google helped Phd students find obscure bits of code
            - Ebay helped collectors buy and sell Pez dispensers
            - Evernote helped moms save and share recipes
        - Talking to everyone symptoms: 
            - 1. Overwhelmed by options 
            - 2. Not moving forward but can't prove yourself wrong because always someone else to talk to 
            - 3. Some hate it and some love it, can't tell which is which.
        - Every feature could be wanted by some segment, and you end up with a so-so product for a bunch of audiences
        - Sales organization, students seem like customer segments but have huge variation.
        - No customer segmentation is like trying multiple business ideas simultaneously
    - Need one type of person with consistent problems and goals. 
    - How to create and choose your customers segment? Who-where pair
        - Customer Slicing, start broad then keep asking these questions
            - Within theis gorup which type of person wants it most?
            - Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them?
            - Why do they want it? (What is their problem or goal?)
            - Does everyone in the gorup have that motivation?
            - What additional motivations are there?
            - Which other types of people have these motivations?
        - Once you have customer groups ask:
            - “What are these people already doing to achieve their goal or survive their problem?
            - Where can we find our demographic groups?
            - Where can we find people doing the above workaround behaviours?”
            - If you can't find them, keep slicing unti you can
        - Choosing group to go after
            - Look for those who seem profitable, easy to reach, and rewarding for us to build a business around
            - Since it will be a good amount of time, worth choosing someone who is both accessible and fun for you to be around
    - Ways to talk to the wrong people 
        - Too broad of a segment and are talking to everyone
        - Multiple customer segments and missed some of them, for example marketplace or apps for kids also need to care about parents
        - Selling to business with complicated buying process and have overlooked some stakeholders
        - Talking to the most impressive people you can instead of actual users
- Chapter 8 running the right process
    - Need to do work and before and after. 
    - Antipattern is business guy communicating what they should do and doing all the conversations. 
        - "The customer said so" => leader is the trump card dictator
        - Learning bottleneck with everything in one person's head
        - Symptoms:
            - "You just worry about the product. I'll learn what we need to know."
            - "Because the customers told me so!"
            - "I don't have time to talk to people - I need to be coding!"
    - Prepping
        - Ensure you know your current list of 3 big questions
            - Figure them out with your team
            - Chapter 3: Asking Important Questions
        - Create an existing set of beliefs of what person cares and wants, spend up to an hour
            - Easier to guide conversation if you have existing set of beliefs you are updating
            - Consistent customer segment means this should be once
            - If a question can be answered with research, take a moment to do it
        - Take 5 minutes to do basic research on company and person
        - Sit down with whole founding team when you prep to get business and product
            - Some might complain about need to build and shipping speed over derisking and validating business
        - The one question in prep: What do we want to learn from these guys? 
            - If you don't know, you shouldn't bother having the conversation.
    - Reviewing
        - After update your beliefs and 3 big questions as appropriate. Put learnings on paper and in everyone's head
        - Talk through key quotes and main takeaways of the conversation
        - Meta conversation questions:
            - Which questions worked and which didn't? 
            - How can we do better next time?
            - Were there any important signal or questions we missed?
        - Keeps you in sync, leads to better decisions, prevents arguments, and allows whole team to benefit
        - Audio transcript not very valuable because too long.
    - Good notes
        - Keep team in loop and harder to lie and easier to reference in a long time
        - When possible write down exact quotes
        - Make symbols or emojis
            - emotions 
                - :) excited
                - :( angry  
                - :| embarrassed
            - their life
                - pain
                - goal
                - obstacle 
                - workaround
                - background/context
            - specifics
                - feature request or purchasing criteria
                - money or budgets or purchasing process
                - followup task
        - Write specific names and companies
            - If they mention someone, write it down to ask for intro at end. 
            - If competitor or solution, look it up later
        - Where to write it down
            - You want notes that are:
                - able to sorted, mixed, and rearranged
                - able to be combined with notes of the rest of your team
                - permanent and retrievable
                - not mixed in with other random noise
            - Notebooks basically useless, so go for permanent GDocs or spreadsheets
            - In person, computer is rude so usually go for index cards then transfer after meeting
            - Index cards good, computer bad signal in person. 
                - Set it not between you and eye contact.
            - Most people agree to record if you promise its not going anywhere
        - Useless if you don't use the notes.
    - Tech guys don't have to go to all meetings, but two people should be at them with one taking notes. 2nd person can jump in and fix them.
    - This can't be outsourced
        - Founders need to be in meetings since bad news is hard to hear and communicate
        - Can hire to help set and lead meetings
    - Talking to customers is tool not obligation, if its not going to help don't waste time
        - Signs your going through motions
            - You're talking too much
            - They compliment you and no next steps
            - No notes, not looking through notes
            - You got unexpected answer and it didn't change your idea
            - You weren't scared of any of the questions you asked and not sure of big questions you're trying to answer
    - The Process
        - Before conversations: 
            - Segment
            - Learning goals
            - Next steps commitments
            - Figure out who to talk to
            - Best guesses about what person cares about
        - During conversations: 
            - frame the convo
            - casual, not sales
            - good mom test question
            - deflect complments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals or emotion
            - take good notes
            - try to get commitments to see if they care
        - After batch of conversations: 
            - Transfer notes
            - share with team
            - update your beliefs and plans
            - next 3 big questions.
    - Don't spend a week, prepping for meetings. Spend an hour or you are stalling
    - Don't spend months doing full-time customer conversations, spend a week maybe two to get your bearings then give them something to commit to
    - At Max Monday/Friday meeting, 1 hour. Spread learning.
    - Building should happen in parallel. Will still have risk. Customer learning should be easy and valuable.
- Chp 10 conclusion
    - Author still makes mistakes
    - People loves startups and want to help
    - Don't get stuck in the process, just execute and be simple
