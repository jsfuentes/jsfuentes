Part 1 existential basics
Intro to shadow
- what if deep down everything was dangerous and source of pain? 
- what if all the bad stuff in your life is cuz you like it that way
- I had abusing relationship how violent and controlling he was, made me feel important and I thought I  don't deserve more
- actually feel the joy of your life and suffering
- not sexual kink, existential kink. Pervase desire for pain and bondage in daily existence
- our conscious minds are just tip of iceberg
The unconscious
- Alex wants to feel taken care of, be dependent. Loses his job and moves in with his parents and likes it
- existential kinks
	- only being able to earn certain of money
	- only go for partners that are vaguely similar to parent or first love 
	- mean voice of teacher so you avoid creating
	- Overindulging in food or drugs to overcome feelings
	- Not liking your body no matter the shape
	- victimized and if only other people or group would leave you alone
	- Being sensitive and taking things personally
- most people never fix these patterns
- many traditions have idea of staying present in both pain and pressure and sex and death, transmute these energy
Lesson 1 super freak divine alchemy
- if god is everyone and this works is gods choice, he is one kinky guy
- Reclaim the pleasure of the game like god
- inner divinity and curiosity for full spectrum of experience
- We consciously want only "good" stuff and we can get it and still be miserable
- The "United" will , some tradition about doing magic needs it 
- If self contains everything, you want to see yourself as seperate ego so you create a conception cut off from whole self 
- shadow integration is self integration
- we pretend we don't have a love of scarcity, only wealth
- witchy(witch originally meant one who makes her own fate) more feminine path to great work
	- Learn to get off and reintegrate scariest part of ourselves
	- Tantric, sensual path
- You constantly perform your identity so you generate situations and relationships that mirror your identity
- Your life mirrors your deep beliefs
- "you are not who you think you are"
	- Remind yourself of this often
- the spirit generates ideals and knows all is perfect and our ego can misinterpret this as the way things should be
- existential kink is magic is psychological integration is where feminine unconscious becomes pregnant With masculine perfection spirit to positive manifest ions, this is immaculate conception
- Most people think they are living wrong and not good enough so they rhyme with and affirm in their life wrong and not good enough
The lesson 2 - the seven axioms of existential kink
- “having is evidence of wanting” (similar to the constant is you)
	- Experiences you have are evidence that perhaps your demonic part wanted
	- Vast taboo level of approval makes them have less power over you
	- Dont shame
- also look at any repeated experiences you keep having
- Collective unconscious results from repressed shadow desires together
	- the best way to address collective unconscious issues is to become better aware of your own unconscious and others as collective is individuals with shadows
- Orgasmic birth where you take pain of birth as pleasure 
- why don’t we experience pain of life as fun like bdsm? 
	- Choice? So pretend or accept that some part of you playfully wants these painful situations, behaviors, or mood
- “It’s possible to get off on any stroke” - orgasmic meditation where you someone strokes you on clit lightly and you can get off any even ones you Don’t like
- our ability to control turning on out of depends on how willing we are to totally approve of your life
- Approach sadness that
	- hmm exquisite how does the feel what’s he texture , aesthics(whoa your emotions don’t be reflection of something)
	- only loser feel sad my life sucks I’m screwed
- conscious celebrate fulfillment give them freedom and light, expand kink
- shame is the magic killer
	- Shame is where you are ceding magic as conscious and unconscious link is severed
- Truth is sensational and it means that is true
Lesson 3: EK the basic
- when you are depressed this can just lead to rumination, so only when good mood
- You could like scarcity, romantic rejection, etc
- steps
	- Get in relaxed state with yoga or sitting or bath, experiment first and your body so you can feel subtle sensation 
	- Create container of space and time with candle(emotional anchor to signal time) and 15 mins, this way you don’t worry about it taking too long
	- identify situation in your life that your conscious mind/ego doesn’t like
		- (No girls)
		- best situations are repeating persistent pattern 
	- identify what feelings you associate with this situation
		- (Fear of rejection and making someone uncomfortable) 
			- (Maybe I really like putting someone down who likes me, making them sacrifice to be with me and want them to know I’m better, kinky, yea you want pavi to feel like you are too good for her)
			- (Maybe I will fall in love with someone just to prove to myself it wasn’t about sex and ask for her back just to prove a point)
		- (Rejection and loneliness/being alone independence)
		- (Powerlessness cuz need sex for someone but can’t do anything cuz illegal or manipulative, so the thing to do was to become someone who can get it if they want to)
		- (Revised 1/24, its about being inadequete and inexperienced)
		- Story of someone who looks for someone to criticize her cuz fun 
	-  Get into touch with kinky part, “having is evidence of wanting”. Put aside judgement of who you think you are.
		- **say playfully aloud “I’m willing to stop pretend I don’t enjoy X tremendously” “it’s ok to feel forbidden wicked enjoyment of X”** 
		- feel it like excitement or relief 
		- (Wow I’m alone like a g, I can do anything)
	- Get on the side of your shadow and feel gratitude for the situation your unconscious brilliantly created
		- Meet conscious with unconscious and this is moment of transmutation 
- Our self wants to experience all emotions not just one’s conscious likes as positive
- Future oriented ek
	- If your anxious or fearful, do ek on what could happen
		- Get off on humiliation then let it go
		- **oooo how hot would it be if everyone just hated me haha, let you see how your mind makes it sad**
			- (oooo how hot would it be if the entire world was against my happiness, how hard that would be, actually felt something)
	- let go of attachment to outcome, enjoyment pure and simple is what you want so just get it now, kinky pleasure, you allowed to feel bliss anytime
- try ek journal playing around why you resist feeling pleasure
	- (Pleasure of being alone and independent and just getting consent)
	- might be changing your ego, ego death then what do you do
- notice game making of drama and theater is feeling fun of tension, what motivates pain 
	- as a all powerful being I like to play the game where I really care about other peoples judgment and I try to be so perfect they can’t judge me and I get to feel guilty and afraid of doing wrong 
	- I like to play a game where I can’t get past my past so I feel weak wrong and alone
