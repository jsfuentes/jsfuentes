Follow-up

Phone call can be good, but some people don't answer intentionally.

Young people losing ability to hold sponetous conversation

"Hey [name], we are going on a date"- strong opener. Women annoyed to hangout instead of date(as expected)

Invitation should be something specific at a specific time, humurous tone, and callback

Fyg

**Other Worlds**

Qatar people have marriage be to get out of controlling families. Tinder gives opportunity to meet random people more options.

Japan has so called herbivore men and carnivorous women. 45% of women aged 16-24 "were not interested in or despised sexual contact"  on girls is sleazy, relationship is a commodity sold without fear of rejection. Buenos Aires has intense level of cat calling. Woman cant say yes too fast and be cheap. So, no means an eventual yes and just ignoring is the only way.

France has highest level of infidelty. Ee find it seplorable and rank it worse than xloning and suicide. But it happens. In france, its almost expected. Feance pm had mistress show up.

**Our World**

More choices = more picky, every option to be compared not enough time spent cultivating

Passionate vs Companionent Love

Should focus more on 2nd and 3rd dates then boring old 1st dates

Excesses of options can lead to paralysis. 24 jams. Were more likely to stop but 10x more likely to buy if only 6

**Online Datin**

Easier to send one text then personal ones cuz only 85% as efficient.

The best photos for men are the ones where they aren’t smiling and are looking away from the camera. Other good photo options are ones where dudes are posing with animals, showing off their muscles, or doing something interesting.

**Old World**

Work and neighbor used to be the only options so you cultivate those. Married to get out of the house, young. From fathers arms into yours. People could still find themselves happy growing together and shit.

Overweigh The few things you do know about them like appearance at first meeting

Cheating easier with tech. Breaking up through media 56%, 16% in person.

Social media easy outlet to reconnect with exs. Upgrade scare.
