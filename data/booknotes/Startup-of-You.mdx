Reid with Netflix shifted to streaming early because they knew it was the future. Doesn't make 3 or 5 years plan. That's an eternity , always testing and evolving. Perpetual beta.

Us too. Everyday is a new opportunity. 20 years of experience is often 1 year 20 times.

Goal of book adapt to uncertainty and changing world.

Chapter 2 develop competitive advantage with assets , aspirations, and market realities.

Just as an entrepreneur can finish the sentence, we are better then the competition because. You should have an answer for someone hires me because. How are you better, faster, or cheaper. Can't be best at everything. Determine your own local competitive advantage. Align with your values so you can do it in the long run.

Assets: articulate what you have now. Tech AND Japanese expert is a solid combo.

Aspirations and values: power, money, dreams, etc. The person passionate about what they are doing will outwork others. Even if contrary to assets. Identity emerges. "Help interesting people do interesting things"

Market realities: Instead of making something people want, have clients and partners want to buy your time. Market that don't exist don't care how smart you are. Always places and industries with momentum. Be in position to ride them. Be passionate and competent.

Complex optimization of three pieces. Academics write for elite of 50 people with hyper specialization. All advantages are local, pick a hill with less competition.

Chp 4: plan for change

Common philosophy to have grand goal in mind and chart path there. Presumes static world. Flickr came out of game. Making a plan early in your career limits yourself to today's options. Real planning without plans.

AbZ planing. A should be ideal, B should be related. Z is the lifeboat if all your plans go to hell and you want a major life change. This lets you take the uncertain risks in A and B. Good plans need to have specific assumptions that need to be true so you can track them over time. PRIORITIZE LEARNING. College is foregoing money now to build skills like early tech companies. For many, this learning stops after college and only focus on hard assets. As much as you can , prioritize learning about yourself and the world to make more money in the long run and live a more meaningful life. Learn through trial and error. Curious about something, go help out for free and see or get short job. Make reversible small bets. Management consulting has great flexibility. Maintain identity seperste from company and career. Hoffman was unsure if he had the tech skills and could make a network enough to succeed. So he tried and got a job. Figured out PM is important and product market fit, How to get experience to be PM. Sought out head of PM in group at Apple offered to work for free and write up stuff. Hoffman cofounder socialnet and helped out with PayPal. Plan b was deepen PayPal relationship or get a regular job. Don't have to be failing when you shift, sometimes forced. Leader of times gains moved to digital multimedia and despite decades of experience was constantly learning video web tech from his subordinates. Spend time to test drive jobs. Vocotion vacation. An actual company. Invest in yourself.

- Do side project with someone in your network

Chp 5: Network

Vc back smart and adaptable people because they will adapt to find value. Strength of co-founder and team is strength of CEOs. Zuckerberg spent half of his time recruiting. Professor at Stanford has evidence that strong relationships and relationships with your boss can be more important then competence for promotions. Could make sense team players win. Fast way to change yourself is to hang out with people that are already like you want to be. We are in a hero culture where we looks t individuals instead of teams that succeed. Individuals make good single thread stories. Tidy narrative s are misleading and any successful person is embedded in a web of support. Team fin business world tend to perform at level of worst team member. Personal and professional are most seperste because of expectation. Sometimes they conflict like your friend wants you recommend them for a professional job. The best negotiators spend more time creating shared ground and understanding what the other person wants.

Relationship builders don't keep score and prioritize deep realyionships and meet people through friends and feiends and have long term perspective. Don't go for numbers Instead of asking what's in it for me, ask what's in it for us. Building relationships should be fun to understand mystery of experience. How to win friend and influence people is misunderstood because you dont win friends. Your current network is opening and closing career doors for you right now.

Professional allies: can maintain 8-10 at a time. Someone who you go to for advice and regularly pursue opportunities with them and listen to them interests. Promote their brand.Want to include them in opportunities. Similar interest and driving force. Seeing what someone is reading is a derivative of their minds. Delicious. Trust is having recrirocity that became emotional.

Weak ties: people you are friendly with and spend a limited amount of time. 55% got job from weak ties. Social Cliques are very likely to mirror you and the same info recycled through your group. So weak ties got more new info and new circles. At a certain point, you can't have new relationships without sacrificing old. Dunbar studied 150 in tribes and good military groups, how many can survive together as a tribe. 6 degrees of separation, online social networks make degrees of seperation. Three degrees of separation ideal because everyone in chain knows source or target so care about message. 40 friends =54k to get intros to. 170 = 2 mil. Hoffman only invests through intro. Be clear why you aren't wasting that person's time when reaching out. Okcupid gets higher response rate with messages like "I noticed" "You mentioned" "I'm curious". Best musicals in study were run by people with a healthy medium of strong, weak, and no ties. Bank in bangedesh loans to groups for pretty pressure to pay back and loans multiple strongly tied groups because they most likely to pay back cuz diversity of thought. Strong ties likely have same friends and opportunities as you. Not number of connections, but trust and diversity.

Maintaining networks: help prematurely. Even if you aren't an expert, you can help. Cheap easy things for you that are very valuable like intros. Let yourself be helped. Bridge across domains. Following up multiple times and it might not be needy, wait til no. Can make reaching out less weird by saying I'm trying to meet up with old high school friends. Social media is great for letting people know even if they don't like or whatever. One guy when he went to Seattle, made it a point to fly out to CA overnight if someone asked him to dinner. Preallocated money and keep friends. Interesting people fund. Status is important professionally, one will always be perceived to be smarter, more accomplished. More convenient meeting place for higher status. Tardiness is classic power move. When you offer help, implies you can.

Actions:

- identify top 5 people you spend time with
- Intro 2 people you know who don't know each other to help
- Ask for intro or relevant article
- Who would you reach out to if you needed a job, do it now
- Make a big event that friends can invite their friends to

5 Pursue Breakout Opportunities

High quality people and stretches you and new upside. Curiosity get it being with curious people. Court good random need. Opportunities are attached to people, and follow through networks. Benjamin Franklin and America is know for creating informal associations that exchange opportunities. Meetup. DIY, DIOurselves. PayPal mafia, evaluate group by people, have something in common, collaborate. Focused convo about something. Jeff Bezos told his friends he wanted a women that would get him out of a third world prison, resourceful. Keeping options open is often more of a risk then taking a plan of action.

Chp6 take intelligent risk

Entreprenuers good at assessing risk that are worth it for them. Most people overate risk. Good for survival. One stern negative recommendation outweighs many positive. Worst case analysis is the way most good people makr decisions. Could you handle it. Reversible. Uncertainty doesn't mean risky. Young have less downside. Competitive advantage is valuing things other people undervalues. Being contrarian and right is how you win. Like jobs with low pay and high learning,contract gigs, fast learning young people. Down economies has lower risk than people think do company because many are scared off with less competition for talent and attention. Small burns prevent big burn, black swans wreck low volatility stuff because less resilant. Seeking risk makes you resilant and being safe is a dangerous life pattern.

Sort people into domain experts, people who know you and feeling , really smart people. Ask higher status people many questions and equals have more of conversation with your thoughts. Ask domain experts how you should frame question and equals about specifics. Dig on qualifiers, what do you mean by not a lot?
