title: 'Zealot'

## First Impressions From First Few Chapters Thoughts
I’ve read the gospel recently trying to see Jesus as just a philosopher that happened to be swept up in the grander narrative of religion. Look at Jesus just as a teacher whose words and wills might have been misinterpreted, a man who sees a moral philosophical problem to be solved. But as the author says, with so little detail any scholar can see whoever they want. The author with way more rigor sees Jesus as not a philosopher, but a zealot directly involved in the political turmoil in Palestine. Born in a particularly tumultuous time between Roman rule beginning in 60 bc and a successful Jewish revolt in 60 ad leading to a slaughter within a few years, Jesus emerged as one of many messiahs for a particularly zealous, religious people. He was born in poverty and began by just preaching to the lowly, but grew into the Icon for a future civilization through a fiery heart of rebellion reflected not just in him but his Jewish contemporaries.

## Notes
####  Author note
- author born Islam turned Christianity raised Bible sucked but studied it and grew to love jesus
#### Intro
- none of books actually written by name, but was common practice
- **Mark is first written book, so Mark most accurate**
- Know it’s accurate if in multiple books, conducts church doctrine, or adheres to known culture
- First non Christian note about Christ is a throwaway line in 100ad from Jewish historian saying that Jesus fellow they call the messiah
- gospel not meant to be bio but work of faith, about Christ not the man
- most widely accepted theory is Mark written 70Ad. About four decades after Jesus death
	- No infancy narrative, No ressurection appearance , tomb Just empty
	- Matthew and Luke began two decades after mark with third document called Q can infer from shared data, 90-100
	- John written last, 100-120
	- there are many more gospels written in second and third centuries like gospel of Thomas showing varying ideas
- **only two hard historical facts**
	- **Jesus was Jew who led popular movement in Palestine**
	- **Rome crucified him for it**
- Jesus the zealot revolutionary caught up in political religious turmoil of first century Palestine not gentle shepherd
	- crucifixion exclusively crime of sedition in rome, 
	- Jesus king of Jews sign was about his crime of trying to be king being treason
		- Greek criminals on both sides are often translated as theives but closer to bandits which Rome used as the most common designation for an insurrectionist or rebel
	- calling for “kingdom of god” very clearly understood as implying revolt against Rome
- why gospel temper this?
	- All gospel written after Jewish rebellion against Rome in 66 ad
		- for 4 years, Jews held holy land before Roman butchered Jerusalem and lead rest out in chains
	- second century Jewish divorced ie Deon this zeal and replaced Temple with Torah at center of life and rabbinic Jewish emerged
	- Christian’s distanced themselves too by changing Christ into peaceful not revolutionary
		- this Jesus could be accepted by Roman’s
- this book reclaims Jesus that after proactive entry into Jerusalem, brazen attack on temple, was arrested by Rome for sedition
- Scholars see Jesus they want to see, hopefully it’s possible
### Part 1
#### Prologue, a different sort of sacrifice
- in ancient Judaism, one temple of Jerusalem was only place to experience Passover, Pentecost, the harvest festival of sukkot paid for by tithe 
	- buy animals to sacrifice, preisethood hereditary from Moses family
		- priests get meat and hide, blood goes to corners of altar of bronze and wood
		- Different levels people are allowed by gender and whether they offer, so much slaughter in air
		- Highest point in Jerusalem in center where arc of covenant was one held now just gold, people draped hole of god
			- only head priest allowed here
	- temple largest bank and center of commerce for Judea, contains legal documents and records, theocracy coined to describe Jerusalem
	- some see these priests as lovers of luxury, ideal state with land worked by slaves and employing and taking a cut from money
	- head priest write 12 gems breastplate, Royal people gold embroidered, 
		- Yom Kippur high priest atones for everyone’s sins
- 56 ad, high priest assassinated
#### 1 a hole in the corner
- Roman took Jerusalem in 63 bc when it had 100k people
- Jews loved Jerusalem but they were just backwater religiously fever pop to large empires like Babylon who razed City, to Persians, to Alexander, to Egypt
- Maccabees freed Jerusalem from Seleucid in 164 BC, before rome took it in 63 bc
- Standard Roman policy to ally with landed aristocracy in captured city to make them financially/power dependent on Rome 
	- In Jerusalem, temple priests who did Roman taxation
		- rome needed high priest control  so appointed and deposed of him, kept custody of high priest sacred garments giving only during holidays
		- Jews were excused from direct emperor worship in return for sacrifices (tax)
	- Rome generally tolerate of other gods if it adapted to Rome 
- Rome surprised by Jewish strict devotion and monotheism and sense of superiority
	- Jews came bc they literally massacred everything there because God gave them the land(deuteronomy 20:17-18)
	- To this hard core sect, the heroes of old would drown the land in blood if they knew heathers and foreigners were in Jerusalem and controlling the high priest
#### 2 king of Jews
- Cesar Civil War in background
- Roman rule and money caused small farms to be replaced by large estates leading to rapid urbanization
- Farmers new tax to Rome leading to total tax at half of yield
	- Crazy terms lead to peasants losing lands
		- some became rebels, bandits helping dispossessed and stealing for rich the source of woes 
		- Bandit gangs were agents of god, first stirring of revolution
			- Hezekiah, one of most fearsome, declared himself the messiah
				- messiah means anointed one, goal to rebuild the nation of Israel so basically declaring war on rome
- Herod, son of father appointed by Caesar, launched bloody campaign capturing hezekiah
	- 40 bc, loser of throne when time took over used the Parthians, enemies of Rome, to retake the city
	- 37 bc Herod retook Jerusalem, massacred and replaced temple priest class, and had brutal rule that involved killing many members of his own family
		- uniquely stable with many public works projects
		- Client king so Rome didn’t really administer just collect taxes
		- Brought Roman language and architecture but also huge rebuilding of temple
	- Of 24 Jewish sects, 3 were influential
		- Pharisees were lower middle class rabbis who interpreted laws of masses
		- Sadducees conservatives agreeable to Rome priests from wealthier fams
		- essenes priestly movement with separate authority from temple
	- **Herod died in 4 bc and kingdom split among sons and huge wave of revolts began**
- Caesar sent troops to Judea and in 6 ad made it a provide directly ruled by rome
#### 3 you know where I am from
- **Nazareth has no more than hundred Jewish families**
	- **illiterate, one well, no roads, everyone farms in self sufficiency**
	- So obscure, not On many maps and rarely mentioned
	- **That Jesus came from here us only fact about his childhood we can be fairly confident**
		- He was often known as “the Nazarean”
- why do Matthew and Luke claim he was born in Bethlehem?
	- Both Matt and luke then proceed to call him the Nazarean 
	- Simply saying someone is the messiah could be criminal offense
		- Some thought he would restore Jewish power
		- Others thought he would rebuild the world
		- Mix of priest and king
		- Descendant of king of David, who was from Bethlehem
			- Luke(weitten 100-120ad) has insane story of census demanding you travel back home for tax reasons?, explicitly noting Joseph in line of David from Bethlehem 
				- There was census in 6 ad but in place of residence cuz obv 
- history being factual events a modern concept, gospel writers more used history to reveal truths
	- No sharp distinction between myth and reality
- Mark the first gospel written, doesn’t mention Jesus birth, origin, or resurrection solely ministry 
	- only showed up to be baptized
- weirdly all messiah prophecies agree he is human not divine
- **Jesus born between 4bc and 6bc in Nazareth**
#### 4 the fourth philosophy
- Jesus called to be woodworker in one verse in gospel
	- if true, Jesus in lowest class just above slaves with title used as slang for uneducated and illiterate which Jesus likely was
		- 97% of Jewish peasants couldn’t read,
- Hebrew language for scribes, Greek for Rome, and Aramaic for Jewish peasantry which Jesus likely spoke
	- Jesus probably didn’t debate scholars in temple or read in nonexistent Nazareth temple described in Luke 
- Paul And gospels both mention Jesus brothers, with his brother James becoming important early church leader
	- At least 4 brothers
	- Consensus is Joseph died while Jesus was a child
		- Perhaps didn’t exist
- **Virgin birth mentioned in both Matthew and Luke though written independent implies the myth was important, though Paul and John never mention it**
	- **Perhaps it was out of wedlock birth, Jesus opponents liked to call it out**
- also unthinkable for 30 year old Jewish man to not have wife
	- But no mention anyway of Jesus wife and children
- To support their trade, Jesus and brothers likely worked in nearby Sepphoris, second most important town in Judea 
	- Roman influence wealthy Jewish city
- Herod death stopped massive public work projects employing many former farmers, so back to unemployed bandits
	- Judas the Galilean rose, supposedly son of hezekiah
		- Launched fourth philosophy commiting to freeing isreal and one god, zeal
			- zeal and zealots real known term for a hardcore brand of Jews in that time 
			- “Whoever sacrifices to any god but the lord alone shall be utterly annihilated” Exodus 22:20
		- first to fuse zealotry and banditry
	- 4 bc Judas assault Sepphoris City and seize Royal armory
		- Guerilla war, target aristocracy
		- 6 ad census called implying taxation and Judas appealed to populace
			- High priest in support of census was replaced because of zealots pointing to it as proof of illegitimacy 
	- **Romans captured and killed Judas, then burn Sepphoris to ground, slaughter men, sell women and children**
- **Jesus born when Judas began countryside rampage, and 10 when Judas captured and burned to ground**
	- **New king rebuilt sepphoris and Jesus likely involved in massive project**
		- **Jesus probably spent 6 days a week Building for aristocracy huge houses and returning to his mud hut to sleep**
#### 5 where is your fleet to sweep the Roman seas?
- **pontious Pilates not defender of Jesus, actually known for his depravity at dealing with rebellion**
	- 28 ad-30executed John the baptist and his growing popularity
	- 30 Jesus lead people into jersaleum and overturned temple letting sacrificial animals go, executed
	- 36, Samaritan claim he had saved bezels ago mount gerizim and battalion sent to slaughter them
		- Considered too far by Rome ending his reign
- after pontious removed, messiahs and revolt grew and series of blundering governors
	- When a band of Jews were attacked in Samaria and no Roman justice, Jews took justice into own hands rampaging through samaria
	- sicarii, particularly zealous would just dagger particularly Jews who supported Roman rule, hot high priest in 56
	- Huge revolt as foretold expected even in upper class
- 64 ad, Governor declares Jews owe tax and just take from temple
	- Riots into soldiers sent to massacre including women and children
	- one Roman sympathetic Jew
		- “Will you defy the whole Roman Empire?”
			- They had god
	- Temple police seize temple stopping Roman tribute, clear act of independence and east of Jude’s would soon follow
		- Burn public records
#### 6 year one
- 73 ad just a thousand siccari, dagger jews, survived Roman onslaught as Jerusalem burned to the ground and slaughtered
	- Masada naturally fortified where David hide from king Saul
- After revolt, Jews made money proclaiming year one
	- Ménahem leader of siccari declared himself messiah king of Jews
		- temple captain saw a power grab and tortured him to death
			- Siccari escaped to masada
- 73 ad, 3 years after Jerusalem fell, Roman come to Masada 
	- siccarri committed suicide
- why did it take so long
	- 60k Roman men sent to crush revolt
		- But before they reached Jerusalem, huge political unrest as Nero died and Vespasian returned and his supporters seized control
			- Vespasian neededa big triumph, slaves captives spoils, undo insult to Roman strength, sought to destroy judea
	- meanwhile, lots of internal discord in jerusalem
		- moderates wanted to surrender to Rome seeing huge refugees pour in everyday
		- Zealot party just wanted to believe in god
	- Titus just showed up and built stone wall around Jerusalem and waited for them to starve, sought to destroy their god
		- 70 ad as bodies piled in the streets
		- **Burned entire city, massacred**
			- **leader and most sacred goods, menorah, Torah, taken for triumph**
		- Jews were not allowed to worship they God like every other Roman conquered, they now had to pay extra tax to Rome to pay for Jupyter temple
			- expelled all Jews from Jerusalem and renamed city
- Jews blamed zealotry and distance themselves from revolutionary idealism
	- Brief 2nd Jewish rebellion in 132 ad
	- In this aftermath, Jew named John Mark wore off Jesus of Nazareth in Greek, language of Roman’s
		- Holy land became transcendental, messiah rejected political ambitions
### part 2
#### prologue zeal for your house
- **30ad most essential event to understanding Jesus** 
	- **when he ride donkey into Jerusalem and people yelled hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in name of lord.** 
		- **they put cloaks on the ground like they did for jehu, the king**
		- **Wave palm branches like for Maccabees**
	- **The next day Jesus went into the outer temple courtyard, and overturned tables, releases sacrifices, blocked entrance**
	- when police come, Jesus says my house was to be a house of prayer and you made it a den of thieves
		- then Jesus just walks out!, for committing a offense punishable by death
	- so zealous
- Remember when Jesus is asked about Roman tribute, basically zealot test
	- When Jesus says give to Caesar what is Cesar and give to god what is gods, we get it wink wink independent kingdom
	- this labels him a zealot, a bandit, lestes
- after Passover, authorities come for him in the garden on mount of olives with huge force, maybe hundreds
	- Jesus followers were also well armed
		- After Passover, “if you don’t have a sword, go sell your cloak and buy one”
- Jesus arrested for sedition and forbidding tribute to Rome which he doesn’t deny
	- His plaque says king of Jews , sedition claiming to be messiah
	- **“Jesus was crucified by Rome because his messianic aspirations threatened the occupation of Palestine and his zealotry endangered the temple authorities”**
#### 7 the voice crying out in the wilderness
- John the Baptist came from desert telling people the end was near, preached at lip of Jordan River
	- he would baptize people going across the river as they entered Jordan Side entering kingdom of god
		- Baptism not new, cleansing
	- supposedly executed for criticizing marriage of leader, some weird domestic shit
		- More likely had to do with John’s popularity potentially leading to revolt
	- His fame far outlined him with followers still baptizing and recounting teaching for years
	- Very little on origins
		- perhaps he came from a priestly family, lived life of asceticism
	- perhaps he was an essence, which had elaborate baptism rituals, including a initiation one and was in same area
		- Both John and essenes rejected temple authorities and talked of end times
		- but John is cast as a loner so unknown
	- Mark says baptism was for forgiveness of sins, but author thinks that a Christian projection
		- probably more initiation rite to purify body
- **All gospels agree that around age 30, Jesus left his home and obligations to be baptized by John the Baptist**
	- if initiation or sin cleansing, both imply John was greater which baptists used to argue for their superiority for years
	- Mark first gospel had Baptist be prophet and mentor, last John had it just affirm Jesus divinity
		- Mark has Baptist mention someone better than him is coming
		- Matthew has Baptist recognize Jesus and get permission to baptize him
		- Luke skips over actual baptism
		- John didn’t even have John as a Baptist, just a witness to divinity
- Jesus likely began his ministry as one of John’s disciples
	- all gospels note, Jesus after being baptized didn’t return home, he went into wilderness John has emerged from
		- Likely he just learned from John and his followers
		- likely Jesus first disciples, Andrew and Philip, were not his disciples but John’s
			- Only followed Jesus after John was arrested
		- gospel says Jesus baptized and John also baptized there…
- after John’s death, Jesus finally returned to his family and began preaching something radical
#### 8 follow me
- Roman response to rebellion was scripted: “burn the village, raze the cities, enslave the population”
	- Herod revolt particularly targeted Galilee 
	- Galilean has once been synonymous with rebel
		- Rejected all rule from Jews to Roman
		- Consisted themselves distinct from others in Judea
		- 3 days from Jerusalem and known for not strictly agreeing to temple tributes 
- 10-35ad had Roman ruler in Galilee and built massive cities filled with new class of Roman’s and Greek foreigners
	- land prices soared as feeding huge cities disturbed self sufficient
- Jesus returned to this changed Galiliee 
	- Neighbors outcast the new Jesus, his family believed in him eventually
- “no prophet is accepted in his hometown”, he said before going to nearby fishing village capernaum
	- while food production swelled in capernaum, most of wealth went to land holders and money lenders
		- It was those most disturbed that Jesus Targeted best
- Jesus message was simple, god has seen suffering and was gonna do something about it
	- Got his first followers here, though he perhaps brought some former John the Baptist
	- “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters-yes even his life-he can’t be my disciple “ - Luke 14:26 Matthew 10:37
- **Luke claimed 72 disciples including women like Mary from Magdala**
	- inner core of 12 male disciples
		- Preached without supervision, some former John the Baptist disciples
		- Represented twelve tribes of Israel
- Jesus probably uniquely spoke like a peasant directly from god not learned scribe that John the Baptist probably was
- while Pharisee often enemy in gospel, he actually had good relationship and they often helped and followed him
- Priestly nobility and scholars never got along well with Jesus
	- Jesus most hated Jewish imposter occupying temple
	- High priest caiaphas was main enemy who was most threatened and targeted by temple ruckuz
	- Good Samaritan tell story of two priests passing United traveler before Good Samaritan helps
		- More about condemnation of priests
		- Samaritans considered most impure in Palestine, rejected temple and had their own
- as Jesus popularity grows, one man calls him out and Jesus cuts him off and says silence come out of him and man wriths on floor cries and is still
	- Then news broke out of fishing town and spread
	- for most Jesus was just another Traveling miracle worker and professional exorcist
#### 9 by the finger of god
- **In that time, professional wonder worker was a real vocation**
	- **Jesus did it for free!!** 
- after first exorcist, news spread of free healer and whatever Jesus went he was swarmed by sick who wanted free healing and he did it
- miracles
	- **There is more accumulated historical material confirming Jesus miracles then his birth or death**
	- Senseless to explain rational basis for embellished myths in Bible
	- Real sense in noting that in his time, even his detractors believed he was a exorcist and miracle worker
	- even his apostles are marked by their healing ability
- There were many such miracle workers and exorcists
	- honi the circle drawer, during a drought he made a circle and told god he wouldn’t move until Good has mercy and it started raining at once
	- rabbi hanina Ben dosa prayed over sick and would discern who would live and die
	- Most famous was apollonius of tyana, healed Lame and blind even raising girl from dead
	- Eleazar used amulets and incantations to draw demons out
	- Rabbi Simon Ben yohai could cast out demons by saying their name
		- Like Jesus would command demon to identify itself
	- In acts, Paul is exorcist using Jesus name
- Jews viewed illness as manifestation of divine judgement or demons
- Jesus story was not that weird in his Time
- difference between magic and miracle in divine mind
	- Rome and Bible both against magic
	- Moses performs miracle of turning staff into snake then Egyptian wise men perform derogatory magic
	- his detractors called Jesus magic, his supporters note its his lack of magic that differentiates his miracles
- Jesus spits in eyes to heal blind, very in tune with  magicians of time
- Jesus performed his miracles free, it was message that he was messiah
	- Temple controlled who could enter and has complex rituals for lepers and like to be cleansed
		- healing Jesus directly subverted this authority
#### 10 may your kingdom come
- **the Central theme and unifying message of Jesus brief ministry was the promise of the kingdom of god**
	- The first thing he preached from John the Baptist was”repent the kingdom of god is near “ 
	- Lord prayer has “Our father who att in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come”
	- kingdom of Heaven hardly appears outside gospel, Jesus spoke so often and so abstractly about it
		- But Jesus seemed to reference a present kingdom of Heaven approaching, “The kingdom of god is in your midst” (Luke 17:21)
- **“What Jesus was proposing must have been a physical and present kingdom: a real kingdom with an actual king that was about to be established on earth”**
	- Jews probably understood
	- Sole sovereignty of god was behind Every revolutionary movement
	- **Jesus talk of men inheriting the earth, poor made rich, weak Become strong and” how hard it will be for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of god“ is actually a political call for a massive upheaval**
- “The kingdom of god is a call to revolution”, but did Jesus condone violence in this pursuit
	- “Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth.i have not come to bring peace, but the sword” Matthew 10:34 Luke 12:51
	- Prob not apolitical Preacher who turned other cheek in all cases
- **“Jesus was not a Christian. Jesus was a Jew preaching Judaism to other Jews”**
	- His mission was for and off the Jews an Israel, “solely to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” Matthew 15:24
	- Disciples told to target Jews and didn’t preach to non Jews until two decades after Jesus death
- Love your neighbor as yourself is from Torah, but meant to apply only between jews
	- “you shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself” Leviticus 19:18
	- To foreigners, “You shall drive them out before you. You shall make no covenant with them and their gods. They shall not live in your land” Exodus 23:31-33
- Jesus only knew and worshipped the Torah god that was brutal and destroyed enemies
	-  **Jesus didn’t think he would take over, but believed god would just destroy his enemies for him if he believed** 
		- like god who drowned pharaoh army, brought down walls of Jericho with Joshua trumpet, exterminated Canaanite’s 
- Jesus 12 disciples to fulfill prophecy of Isaiah, when twelve tribes brought for war
	- “If anyone wishes to follow me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” mark 8:34
		- Cross more about self denial, but symbol of sedition
- Jesus many times mentions his future fate, could be post story to make him a prophet but it doesn’t take a prophet to know what happens
	- Jesus in mark 4 tells his disciples they had the real message of the radical kingdom of god, but others hear parables
		- Cuz it’s treason and illegal
- Jesus didn’t have specific plans, but probably imagined he would have a key position
	- pontious on final fresh asked crucial question, are you the king of the jews
#### 11 who do you say I am?
- so Jesus has movement for kingdom of Heaven with twelve disciples ping and healing around countryside but ignoring or not entering massive or Roman cities
- Who is he?
	- perhaps he was Elijah born, a feisty prophet who when others worshipped Baal god challenged them to pray off then massacred them
		- Foretold byMalachi
	- Antipas imagine Jesus is John the Baptist risen from the dead
- late night disciples see Jesus with Elijah and Moses, it is clear he is king of Jews
- Jesus obscured his messianic aspirations swearing those he healed to secrecy and silencing demon who recognized him
	- Likely Jesus actually sought to keep it a secret
- Messiah rule unclear
	- David warrior king messiah who lead revolution, Judas the Galilean
	- Moses liberator messiah freeing followers from occupation, theudas as the wonder worker
	- Prophet messiah preaching end of times, John the Baptist
- but Jesus was wrong about everything…, didn’t fit any of above molds 
	- New church made him greater than all
	- Jesus never proclaims himself messiah
- **Fun fact, son of god was traditional designation for Israel kings**
- Jesus called himself, son of man
	- Could just be idiomatic for man
	- Or could be calling himself the son of man
	- In book of Daniel, son of man given authority over ask nations and people
- Matthew changes Mark verse from kingdom of god to son of man coming in his kingdom implying both terms very linked to Jesus sense of self
	- Jesus likely saw himself as king but used cryptic son of man term 
- after Jesus failed, early church recast him as messiah of divine son of man whose kingdom was not of this world 
#### 12 no king but Caesar
- Jesus and his disciples hidden in garden, but Judas knows where they are and identifies Jesus
- His entire ministry based on tearing down temple
- Mark tells theatrical story of pontious finding Jesus innocent, but Jews want him dead
	- **this tradition of releasing a prison during Passover absurd, no evidence**
		- Jews would know it’sa lie, but mark writing to Roman’s
- A good amount of Christian’s actually sat out rebellion in 70ad
	- With Jerusalem gone, Christianity shifted to scattered across Mediterranean and wanted to avoid Roman hate of jews
- one generation after his death, Jesus had more non Jewish followers then Jewish ones and Roman elite target
	- Jews killed messiah not Roman’s pontious 
		- Newer gospels absolve Roman’s of more and more guilt
		- absurd crowd in John says “we have no king but Caesar”, so blasphemous for time
		- Basis of centuries of Jewish hate from Christian’s
- oral traditions set up passion narrative of last supper, betrayal, arrest, appearance before high priest and pontoons, crucifixion and resurrection, etc mostly as ritual Way to follow along with Jesus last day
	- author believes most cloudy cuz so important to embellish
- crucifixion was common in antiquity
	- Was really cheap form of torture and death
	- v common in Roman Empire, often executed and then hung from cross as deterrent to others
		- public places to rot, rarely buried
		- Reserved for political crimes, treason, rebellion, sedition, banditry
- “Jesus was executed by the Roman state for the crime of sedition”
	- likely pontious just asked if he was king of the Jews and sent him to be executed on just another day
	- Likewise, trial before high priest after arrest “violates nearly every requirement laid down by Jewish law foe a legal proceeding”
		- Not permitted to meet at night, on Passover, Eve of sabbath, in courtyard, first must give Why innocent before witnesses
		- And he should have been immediately stoned to death
			- It’s because he wasn’t convicted for blasphemy by Jews  but sedition by Roman’s
		- they probably did hand him over to authorities though
- Like all other ceuxifications, Jesus this was stripped, whipped, and forced to carry cross to public place where he would be nailed to cross and hang to die within a few hours with many other criminals
## part 3
#### prologue god made flesh
- first to die for calling Jesus messiah didn’t even personally know him, he probably came to Jerusalem on mission and heard from this poor, communal group of the messiah who has already died?? 
	- men who swore he was allowed to be tombed, and then resurrected before their own eyes
		- tale of resurrecting in the flesh and bone was very rare and never prophecied
	- reinterpretation of messiah divorced from scripture by uneducated disciples 
- Stephen as with most converts, probably “abandoned his Hometown sold his possessions, pulled his resources community and made a home for himself in Jerusalem”
	- before mob, Stefan gives long rambling in accurate defense of Jesus and sees him on right hand of the father
		- Blasphemy, equating, power of Jesus and God, someone of flesh to God unheard of
	- 33-35 ad, Saul was in mob who stoned Stephen and 20 years later renamed Paul would call Jesus of Nazareth god 
- **How does a failed Messiah become in a few years the creator of heaven and Earth God itself?**
	- **Besides, maybe Luke gospels were not written by anyone who knew him**
	- Actual uneducated disciples and Jesus’s family Actually had little Impact on spread,
	- The real Translators were the new educated urbanized Greek speaking diaspora Jews
		- “ They gradually transformed Jesus from a revolutionary zealot to a Romanized demigod, From a man who tried and failed to free the Jews from Roman oppression to a celestial Being wholly uninterested in any earthly matter”
	- In fact, the conflict between these two groups interpretations of Christianity Defines the church. One was champion by Jesus, brother James, and the other by the former Pharisee Paul 
#### 13. If Christ has not been risen.
- One story says the veil in the temple that separated the most holy place of God, only allowed by the high priest tore when Jesus died
	- Jesus is death remove the barrier between humanity and God. Everyone could access God without ritual or priestly mediation
- Resurrection is insane, but instead of returning to their villages, Jesus followers Swore until their death he was resurrected
