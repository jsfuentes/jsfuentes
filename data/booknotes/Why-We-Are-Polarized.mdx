title: 'Why We Are Polarized'
---

#Book by [[Ezra Klein]]

- Hillary wrote why I lost and with a few tens of thousands deciding the election in swing states she points out sexism, Comey, scandals could account for margin . 
- Was it actually an anomoly, why was Trump even that close. 
	- Trump won the exact same number of women as Romney. 
	- Trump won the same 80% of Christian's as other Republicans. 
	- Republicans Trump won 88% from 92%. 
	- On paper 2016 really isn't very different. 
- What's surprising is what didn't happen. 
- It is true Cruically young uneducated swung to Trump. 
- Electoral gives Republicans 16% more power. 
- We just vote party and nothing can tear us away from arguing for anything. Enlists our values.  
- This book about: How American became toxic? Why we participate in it and what it means for our future?

Thinking in systems
- This a book about systems not people. 
- There are individuals people that are problems and we blame them for our problems. 
- But we often find replacing the people does little. Complex systems often fail even while succeeding by its own standard. Broken system while no parts are broken. American political is full of rational actors with disfunctional whole. Missing a inspection for a broken plane could be missing the real cause of stock market short term pressure that will relieve itself in other forms. The citizens, media, gov all parts of this broken systems. Each one explains away their own role. Core is this:

"To appeal to more polarized public, political actors and instituions behave in more polarized ways. As political institutions and actors become more polarized, they further polarize the public". 

Feedback loop of polarization. Understanding our institutions are changed by us and us by them is core. Focus of political identity. Identity politics. Everyone in American is engaged in identity politics. So deep in our psyche. Usually about particularly left group, something only marginzed groups have. All of it is influenced by identities. Struggle by which identity will dominate on voting day. We often fight about group identity and status. Zero sum. A merged identity between Democrats and Republicans has such weight it is tearing our instituions apart. 

  

Why Democrats became liberals and Republicans became conservative

Illusion of stability. Between 1830-1860 more than 70 violent incidents between congressman and def an undercount, that just with evidence. Something is genuinely new though. 1950 from most eminent political scientists called for a more polarized political system. Political parties too diverse and public unable to make an intelligent choice between them. Political parties are shortcuts that provide alternatives of action. We know difference between parties, but not climate change, debt ceiling, proper taxation, international diplomacy. 1950 had Democrats more conservative than most Republicans and vice versa. Nixon appreciated diversity as he voted for green and healthcare plan better than Obama care as a republican. Calm transitions of power between two similar parties.  

1959, Republican Party held meeting about whether party skills be guided by principles. With both parties having liberals and conservatives, differences settled by compromise within party. When from distant party, styles through conflict driving divisions. When jimmy carter ran, 54 percent of electorate thought republican posey was more conservative than democrats. 30 thought there was no ideological difference at all. 1972-1980 correlation between house and president was .54. By 2018, .97. Rating for other party has dropped in half. Negative partisanship, more about hating enemy party. Only third driven by support , we actually like our own party slightly less than past. Partisanship has always been a negative term. 

What other things do we think are negative that we have never heard the positive arguments for like equal pay act? 

Priming people with political disagreements, independents rated as more attractive than partisan even when the objective uglier. Since 1994, 39 of democrats and 26 of republicans said discrimination main reason black peoples  can’t get ahead in society. 2017 56 and 14. Every republican signs pledge against raising taxes. Obamacare was heavily compromised already building of Romney’s governor plan with much of growth from private insurance. But not a single republican voted for it in the house or senate. Before Republican Party or joe Biden divided into abortion. Today no room for confusion. Independents and inattentive are more aware of policy differences between candidates than strong partisan people prior to 1980. Differences are bigger now though. Politics risen by most intense activists. 2016 45 and 41 of d and r, viewed other part as threat to nations wellbeing. Of course, people have become more polarized as parties have become more different. That’s a story that revolves around race.

  

Dixie frat dilemma

Strom Therman was conservative on everything. Have longest filibuster on civil rights act, was a democrat though. The southern democrat post hated him because they had negotiated to take the teeth out of the bill if they let it past. Dixie crafts have Democrat’s bits if they let segregation continue. At one point, Democrats has 95% of elected offices. Year after slaveryEnded  90% of bleak’s registered. By 1944, only 5 of blacks who could were registered to vote. Dixie had strength and voter suppression, so no electoral pressure and massive numbers. Northern states let them make mockery of system to move their national agenda and they had power. Segregation was the one issue they cared about. They control many committees that hold peer over bills seen by four. South were left wanting redistribution from rich north to poor south. 1964 votingAct split country not party. 80 of r and 60 d supported bill. Why did democrats known for passing it? Because democrats snapped their alliance with Dixie crafts and held presidency and both houses. Johnson was quoted saying they have south to democrat post for a long time. Are parties polarizing or just sorting. Does it actually change people’s mind to become more extreme or does it just get all the people who believe similarly on an issue together. They both have effects. More intense disagreement pushes parties to take a stand then party members must also decide. Polarization Berger begets polarization ie sorted and more tension

Polarization doesn’t beget extremism??

But it doesn’t beget extremism. Not a single Republicans voted for Obamacare. 2010 more polarized, but is Obamacare actually more extreme than social security an entitlement without a dedicated way to any for it. Early 1900 founded on racial bigotry, sounds more extreme even if less polarized.  

Moderate tend to hold more extreme opinions than either party. People labeled as moderate get views that mix together most parties. Drill down get unmainstream opinions and free to hold much more unpopular opinions than politicians that need support. Civil rights bill cracked Dixiecrats allowing sourthern conservatives to join Republican Party and northern Liberia to join democrat party creating ideological and regional divide. 1952 had small demographic differences. Now the racial diversity has grown with most of it centered in Democratic Party. Evalgenical christians majority religion in r while d majority is the religiously unaffiliated. How democracies die notes this divide of race and religion tend to be the most bitter political lines. Red and blue states wasn’t reallya thing, 7.7% difference between presidential election by party per state from 1972 1984. 2000-2012 was only 1.9. Tale of two Clinton’s bill got half counties Hillary got less than 500. Went from 1 in 20 to 1 in 5 having landslide local election victories where location matters. Preferences later on top of each other. Reflect deep psychological divisions. Fear, perception of how dangerous the world is. Decades of research showing liberals tend to be high in openness to new experience and conservatives are high in conscientious or loyalty and order. Hope for change like Obama slogan is liberal, conservatives like ritual telling world to stop and distrust of outsiders and new. Fluid vs fixed. Fixed worldview more fearful of potential dangerous so like hierarchy order and clear unchanging rules. Fluid are less likely to see world as dangerous believe should give individuals ability to question, explore, and discover authentic selves. Vietnam war opposition was bipartisan.Now at least for whites, this is the dividing line. 1952 psychology identical among d r. Fluid 71 d 21 r. Fixed 60 r 25 d. If you chose at all, Fixed 84 conservatives fluid 80 chose liberal. Study found Psychology doesn’t really predict if you don’t pay attention to politics but among highly engaged very influential. 35% p difference between party overwhelming all other factors. Motivated signals for identity, what does this say about me. Politics to signal who we are. 

  

Chapter 3 your brain on groups

Tajfelt noticed discrimination is similar in rationalization. We vs they. Jew made him categorical bad. Will discriminate even in the absence of any advantage to be gained. He theorized people naturally sort us and them and would then discriminate without any advantage to do so. 64 boys from same school. First they take a visual acuity test. Researchers arbitrarily separate into groups telling them it was by their score on the first. Then did an unrelated task distributing money and they would get no money resulting. The professor completely expected this to show no difference. Large majority gave more money to members of their own group. Next study choice if they would give their group less in total to increase group gap. Even with no cost, they would give less to out group. Sport and sports riots happen in Us and a Canada in all 4 major sports. Loneliness increases stress and depression and more, anyone lonely has micro awakenings throughout the night when they feel alone prob for safety. Social instincts for small scale tribal societies and we trick ourselves to do large scale cooperation. 2015 social study saw "behavior of partisans resemblance that of sports team members acting to preserve status rather than thoughtful citizens participating in polictlca process for broader good". Losing election loses status. Party identity dominates for turnout, volunteering, etc and anger towards other side made effect of every other datapoint plummet. On mission to defeat other team. 2015 Pew survery R from mostly unfavorable to very unfavorable  increase voting by 12 pts. 6pts if more favorable for R. D showed no difference. But, R unfavorable increase donation by 11% and R increaes by 3%. D unfavorable increase 8%, favorable didnt increase at all. Least engaged look at what does this do for me, while most engaged look through lense of what does this say about me. Individual impact of policies less than identity so r voting for tax cuts for rich not necessarily against their best interests. Obama won because he believed in the best of America and was most polarizing at time. We have many identities beyond political, Non political could unite us. Voting can now identify religion, city, interests. One mega identity. This is what changed, merging into a strengthened mega identity. NFL with Colin polarizing companies and chanting trump and Clinton supporters. Cross cutting more tolerant of outsiders. Civil war is 12x less probable if ethnicity crosscut by economic, religion, and region. .25 correlation between policy and party. Feeling closer in identity is more calming than being closer in policy. 2010 49 r and 33 d parents concerned on intrapaety marriage. Care more about political party than 3.5 vs 4.0 gpa. Taboo to hate races but not parties. Party started as cleavage in society, but then is the cleavage now. Mutually reinforcing. Individual mandate had support of 80 before election modeled on Romney. 2009 r told fox that there was support for individual mandate. R even sponsors of previous bill with mandate called it unconstitutional in 2009. Democrats got beyond, truly schizophrenia. 2007 newt and McCain wanted cap and trade, 2010 turned against it. R after 2016 liked Putin more than Obama. 

Press secretary in your mind

Cynicism and insincere? always feel honest to him. Central flaw is it’s individualistic but it’s decentralized and disperse inherently a collective process. Ashe conformity study as group intelligence. Students with particular strong feelings of welfare invited with cover comparing two welfare articles. One had welfare 250 max woth welfare and such other had generous 800, college, child care, no max, etc. both policies were embedded in an article either stated they had democrat support of 95% and had words like blaming republican for victim shaming and lighten financial burden on poor. Or republican version with 95. Republican support with support of reasonable accommodation while still allowing individual responsibility. Reference group overtook policy with Republicans supporting generous and democrats supporting stringent. But hey they are our representatives. Epistocracy count those informed to get more weigh. More info hypothesis: answers are tractable and there are good answers . WRONG.

  

How politics makes smart people stupid

Climate change has overwhelming evidence. Lack of knowledge? Debates about winning reasoning for status. Better educated would mean better argued. Those with better math skills were better at making the math work out for or against their politics. Higher iQ correlates with knowing only more arguments in favor of their fav policy. Terrific scientific show. More informed voters were as likely to get factual questions about budget or something as 50th percentile. Can be rational to be wrong if it keeps you with the group. Conservatives judges less ideological reliable. Identity protective cognition, threaten identity. 

  

Chp 5 demographic threat

Obama hope for future. Trump great again like the past. Minorities will be majority in 2040 with nonHispanic white only group expected to shrink. Women 8% more likely to have college degree by 29 than men. Nonreligious will become majority by 2051. Dominant culture has been white and religious, 54% for Obama 2008 and 2016 43%. 7 out of 10 old people are these people. Fewer than 3 in 10 young adults. Big and fast enough to feel. Public perception changing even faster. Surveys that asked if they knew California was not majority white were then 13 points more likely to say they favor R. Other study split Asian American into two groups. One group had a minor incident of a Us citizenship being questioned moved sharply left. In a white suburb, sent Spanish speakers to Boston train station for three days. Asking people from this station about immigration over these days saw a sharp shift right.Obama more racially radicalized America as a symbol. Political power delayed by a decade, old whites have electoral college and vote more. Advertising ahead by a decade of demographic shifts. Right now white has politics and minorities have culture. Trump was master marketer. America we know and love really is gone. Explicit comparisons of present whites to black south. 

-Made me more conservative, like time will get them anyway

White solidarity for 30-40 % is strong and growing, but without racial hate. White privileged concept shown to radicalize whites. When your accustomed to privilege,   Equality feels like oppression. Cuts both ways, fear is real and can be weaponized. Some citizens are always sacrificing for others, need space for loss. Racial resentment causes economic anxiety not the other way around. Obama or racial resentment, black culture is main reason for racial inequality. Greater racial resentment the worse they believed the economy was doing. Trump election caused 80 pt (massive) among R and 30 pt drop among democrats. Racially resentful most economically optimistic. Right populism across countries different in policies for everything but dislike of immigration especially Muslim. IDW And others point to political correctness as narrowing discussion in powerful university that will lead the nation. But, colleges always had strict speak laws the difference is who gets to decide what’s acceptable. Democractizatoon or uncomfortable. PC really about who has power. Everyone is demanding safe spaces. Bill was against illegal immigration, 2016 Clinton was about redesigning immigration system with empathy. 1994 34 d 26 r said discrimination was main reason blacks can’t get ahead. 217 64 d and 14 r. Mostly by white democrats moved so far left even left then typically black voter. Only identity politics when minority, otherwise just politics. World not zero sum, but sometimes. More female means less male, powerful movement will sprout to counteract. Majority minority America sounds like war. Threat, saying won’t change America power and institutions removes the political shift. Sanders dismissed open borders in 2016, in 2020 even more left with decriminalized illegal immigration. Majority believe browning good. 

  

Interlude

Group is human. Will even choose something worse for us. Next section on political institutions of it currently getting worse. 

  

Chp 6 Media Divide Beyond Left and Right

Almost follow politics like a hobby. Vox competes with other hobbies. Media of newspapers with internet and bliss and Chen ales and radios are sooo crowded with political content. In many political theories democratic limitations was information, but we got it. However people aren’t more informed or engaged. Because we got so much more other media. It’s really about interest. Interest gap bigger than education for political knowledge. Before business model of newspaper was being general and dominate market. Now, political media is target to those interested and wants more people to be interested. To read it at all, you must interested and choose a side making arguments against you painful. Objective coverage of campaigns being run why your side should win, horse race. Party we perceive is different than party  that exists. D thought 44% of R earn over 250k a year actually 2, r believe 38% of d lbgtq only 6%. D believe 4 out of 10 are senior only 2. The more political media more distorted political perceptions. All media is outrage identitarian media focusing on worst of other side. Cable news pressure for ratings very strong metrics every day. Wedding she job is to get you on the floor. Chartbeat shows everyone on your page in real time. Share works that move them, social media about curating identity. 90s kids, Beyoncé fans, love sending out signal only others in your group understand. X only Y understands. Internet let people find interest and identity. Were identities just hidden and market unserved by mass media? Or are identities malleable? YouTube loves upping the stakes jogging turns into ultramarathons. Social media shifted organizing principle, mutual enemies quick way to make a friend. Conflict gets more to look. “Reading the other side doesn’t change our minds it depends our certainty.” Nerd is great identity for deep journalism, better identities. If only we watched other side! 220 d or r would follow bot about other side. Month long follow of popular voices, conservative became Substantially more conservative and liberals had minor liberal increase. You instantly trigger rebuttal not reflection, positive collaborative interaction with other side works though. Supporters tweet to their supporters. If you force people to watch their own side or other makes them more polarized, but if you give them the remote does nothing. Fox News is persuasive in rollout. Fox pushes trump and Republican Party. Create political systems by perceiving it. Journalists media space shift what they cover and do. “Here’s the dilemma: to cover the news is to be a shaper of the news rather than a mirror held up to the news”. Covering Clinton emails makes it important. Primary intermediary between government and people. Newsworthy, incoherent? Trump got so much 52% of republican coverage, more evening news for trump than entire democratic field on cnn. Obama begged news to take notice, trump will just send out misspelled tweet. “News if journalists decide its news”. If someone covers it, then everyone can cover it obviously newsworthy. Trump lob’s grenades into social divides, weaponizes polarization. Bias towards identities. 

  

Chp 7 post persuasion elections

In recent elections 5 or 6, actually undecided dropped from 22 p to 7. Revolutionary, not swing voters cant persuade, more about exciting people to vote. 2004 changes everything, Bush republican Republicans could feel great about it. Presidential campaigns have shifted to this since 2004, further polarized electoral, Obama mobilized. Hillary first to use systemic racism in speech. Parties weak, partisanship strong. Trump against all elites, called cancer on conservatism. And they later endorsed him... trump or Clinton they said. Party primaries, less than 30% voters. How democracy dies, demagogues. Convention with party insiders have peer review. Officials seen as illegitimate. 2018 removed democratic superdelegates. Parties aren’t weak because rules have change, rules changed because parties are weak. Incumbents particularly in primary party face challenges to 30% for R about not being conservative enough. Joe Crowley be AOC. Large donors corrupting, small donors polarizing. Calling Obama a liar made him a hero with donations, his critic raised more than twice as much against attacking him. Regulations don’t stop money from going to politics but channels to get there. More powerful parties less polarized. Parties prize moderation. To raise it yourself,  Giving is through inspiration, outrage, or transaction. Loud gets noticed. Pragmatist(staying in power) vs purists(passing laws). People give to races they care about instead of closest races. Year up to primary small contributions to 50k to 560k 2000 to 2016. Bernie smashes small donor records. Share of people who know governor went down. State and local way more important and one person can do. Under identity model, national politics of course focus. PAC money more about moderate, institutional pragmatic and investment. Politics is for the polarized or rich. Vast space of unnoticed laws great for corruption politics. People who donate want something different than people who don’t. Past presidential shifts to extreme causes huge loss in senate and houses. Now threat. Clinton won 53% of people who said they motivated by strong support but trump had 11% gap of hating Clinton. Extreme candidate drives greater turnout of opposite party. Trump or democrats. Flaw politics, clever demagogues truly threaten and they are watching.

  

Chp8 when bipartisan becomes irrational

Scalia believed in constitution believed in literal words of dead constitution. Not living constitution. Senate refused to take a hearing for new judge. Unprecedented. McConnell won. Republicans will stop at nothing to gain power, judges serve for life. Not surprising. Real question is why anyone expect anyone would ever confirm a judge. American political system failed in many other countries, but in America it worked. Parliamentary regimes with parliament power becoming presidential, America is the only place where separate president survived. One party holds power. Compromise? Or crisis where military needed? Japan, German wrote their constitution without us gov. Exception. Parties in polarized usually increases conflict between president and Congress. Didn’t McConnell just represent his party. Polarized judges too. Judges rarely disagree with president who appointed them. Nomination means decades of ideological service. Rules set down don’t work with formal method, but informal methods of forbearance. What if Supreme Court seen as Illegitimate? All politics isn’t local. Nebraska got special kickback for Obamacare in red state democrat senator. Regional collation used to be a thing. Founders believed state identity was core, but in 1968 nationality raced ahead of state.  State pride is geography, National Is political. As goes identity so goes politics. Media and politics all National now. Representatives about pay rather than region. National is more polarized. Aca about Party, not how much it would help your uninsured. Used to get state kickbacks, earmarks lead to compromise but in 2011 seen as corrupting and removed. Nebraska punched on democrats senate with governor telling government to keep the money as matter of principle. He didn’t even rerun, got replaced by republican hating on price they could have gotten for free. American politics not very competitive with lopsided party control. This period of close competiton is unique. In last century, last 4 decades had extremely weak leads. Politicians priorities win election, win majority, governor. Compromising means you are part of their election strategy. Permanent minority makes compromise likely. Zero sum. One Party usually dominant enough to make minority compromise. Senate Filibuster. Wasn’t supposed to exist. Mistake, burr just cut it . Used to have unstoppable filibuster, but rarely used because of norms. Minority punish majority. 3 weeks in 2009 for something that passed 91-1. Debt ceiling, treasury bonds are risk less assets. 2011 debt ceiling. Spending negotiated separately from budget. 

  

Chp 9 difference between democrat and republicans

2012 people spent their politics capital bomb on Republican Party. Book calling on anti science, partisan, abomination of gop. Trump was next step, authentic expression of Republican Party. D 2019 lead by same team of 2006. Why so different? D have immune system of diversity and democracy. R doesn’t. Both affected, r more.

 Diversity. Republican overwhelming sameness and white. Black most fixed race.  D nonwhite coalition of difference. Self identity of Conservatives majority 35 to 26 historic high. Twice as many interest groups in democrats. >80 of conservatives approved of trump. Study showing trump take both libera and conservative positions. Showing whichever position the people most strong saying they are conservative move to trump regardless of the side. It’s an identity not idealogy. Conservatives much narrower in news source. 2016 40 p of r to news sources Fox. D had like 20p cnn. Liberal media respect each other as try not to be democrat mouthpiece and try to be admired journalistic by other media, r discredit their competitors and operate in their own sphere. 

America isn’t a democracy. 2018 r hold house, senate, and president. D won all the popular votes. R should be expected to win 65% of election which they narrowly lose popular vote. Strat of r would change if trump lost. Tea party about losing country they love. Barr trump attorney general, joined trump why? 20th was democracy be fascism and communism.  He argued 21st century America was built on top of insight free government only suitable and sustainable for religious people. Now on all out attack by liberals with academic and media against religion and dissenters. Liberal can use any means to achieve their momentary moral victory. Both parties have majority that want their party to be more conservative.

  

Managing Polarixation and Ourseves

We don’t argue over policies we don’t discuss. Polarization pro and con. Polarization is logic’s outcome of institutions, incentives, and identities, and payhcology. Divisions will prove the norm.path forward is clear, reform the system so it can operate under polarization.  ThreeReform bomb proofing, democratized, and balancing. 

Bomb proofing: make polarization and grand standing not so dangerous. debt ceiling is bizzare and unnecessary risk. Budget process. Maybe have things automatically kick in during recession or budget auto increase with spending. Let the battlegrounds be less dangerous for America with minority wanting recession to continue for election. 

Democratized: make compromise of broad is healthy party and politics. No electoral college through interstate agreement that currently exists with c 70p agreement that all states will give their electoral boots to those who win popular vote. Rank choice voting and no district proportional representation has instant runoff voting and no spoiler candidate so third party viable and makes voting in dominant district not a waste of time. Multiparty democracy is not cure for all that ails us, Europe doesn’t show idea. 

Senate 2 per state is crazy but constitution. Get rid of filibuster it has increased massively. Defenders cite horrible legislation that would pass. “Do you prefer problems of governance or palarlysis? I choose governance in part because I trust Americans to ultimately look out for their own interest?” Could something be central to their lives and irrelevant to their politics. If someone does something bad, people will notice. DC and Puerto Rico would push Republican Party to compromise more. Easier to vote means less polarized people show up. Need less polarized GOP path is forcing them to reach beyond the exthonqtional coalition. 2040, 70p will live in 15 largest states. 30% of senate. Not a stable system. 

Balancing: today strongest identities aren’t state but party. Need to balance parties and rules. Lower stakes could give Supreme Court party line representation. This might not work, but now is broken. Now miniority can barely bring bills to the floor. 

Depolarizing ourselves. Identity mindfulness and rediscovering policy of place. 

Identity mindfulness: All human cognition shaped by identity. Harness it. Fair minded, Christian, animal rights, or state. Get out of superstructure. Which identities are being activated and strengthened. What identities are making you resist? Can you notice? 

Rediscovering politics of place

“We give too much attention to national politics which we can do too little to change and too little attention to state and local.”  Local better because more impact, less polarized because people more similar to you, more tangible so less abstract and ideological. Local becomes federal. I solution only corrections. 

Klein is optimistic. American democracy was worse before with politicians in recent history saying worse things. Democratic index has gone up in past decades according to org judging since 1900. . An improvement today would still be a vast improvement on past. Political assassins were real MLK, Reagen, ajFK. Police escorted students into schools with armed guard. Nixon launched espionage campaign.
