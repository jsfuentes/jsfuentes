title: 'The Listening Society'
---

## Key Points
- “kings road to a good future society is personal development and psychological growth"
- Philosophy is defined as an engine of your mind that has 
	- How you view the world, what is real, ontology and epistemology 
	- Your place in it and self conception
	- What is right and wrong, ethics
- “Science is a whore dressed up as a queen”
- “at the micro sociological level, most humans are doing better then ever. Yet there is so much confusion, suffering, and bitter resentment. **How many beautiful privileged people have I not heard whisper to me, late at night, that if it were up to them, they would never have been born; that they are angry with the world; that they were let down; that they live with guilt and self doubt; that their friends and families are hypocrites? These are signs of alienation sufferered by modern humans”**
	- What we need is open ended abstract direction, General ideas on how to act, stories about stories, meta narratives, social technologies
- Everyone should get therapist growing up, learn to meditate and mindfulness, gym early, debate, year off to look for purpose, sex ed and relationship
- “all our wants, dreams, words, and ideas come from the social environment”
- “metamodern activists relentlessly make naive efforts to do great things, things that are unlikely to occur at each attempt, but almost certain to occur in the long run, somewhere, somehow”
- “the truth is that you don’t have the truth; that you never will” 10/9/23 #quote 
	- “whatever direction you move in, it will lead to contradiction, self destruction, and decay sooner or later”
- if you don’t act and just act normal, you are not responsible. No, you are causing harm
- 90% of people fall in 10 abstract, 11 formal, 12 systematic, 13 meta systematic so you should learn to recognize them
- Metamodern seeks a universal truth with deep sincere faith (postfaustian) that everyone can insolently agree on (modern) while finding all cracks and excluded voices in that story (postmodern)
- each stage advancement requires higher mhc to be able to install, G meta modern requires meta systemic stage 13 so 98% will get condensed version
- ”We live in a screaming world. Because there is suffering untold, existence has us eternally by the balls. This inescapable, unyielding by-the-ballness is our predicament-to which there can ultimately be only one response: to care. The question, then, is only how we care.”
- “Spirituality is a catch all phrase for those human activities, experiences and practices which concern the three highest categories of subjective states — and the perspectives on life and the world that flow from such states”
- **spiritual congregations where you devote yourself to an enlightened guru are actually a modern phenomenon, 19th and 20th century**
- “depth is a persons innermost recognition of the greatness and/or seriousness of reality”
- "to be spiritually mature means both accepting the unavoidability of suffering and being resolved to prevent and mitigate it"
- "only a sense of tragedy can drive us to work for the wretched of the earth: loving until it hurts"
- there is light and dark depth for higher or lower states
	- **without dark depth can't understand the depressing insights of Schopenhauer and the Buddha, denial of tragedy**
	- **without light depth you get modern philosophy from Schopenhauer and existentialists which argues you can't achieve prolonged periods of higher subjective states b/c no spiritual practice**
- “What have I lived for? Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: The longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.” - Bertrand Russell’s biography
	- **“this has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered to me”
- effective value meme
	- Faustian
		- ambivalent gods represent aspects of society above society and nature
		- **“the self must find its destiny, ie which place the self has in the social hierarchy”**
	- PostFaustian
		- Ontology, Not interests of group but larger morality as world is second to eternal world of God
	- Modern
		- Self is individuals with right to express individuality in this world, think rationally as citizens
		- Ontology, scientific perspective can satisfy all human needs and reveal knowable truth through intersubjective verification as universe is purely materialistic
	- Postmodern
		- "Doesn't believe in progress but rather that societies change over time"
		- Ontology, ultimate reality is Symbols structures and culture and we can't go beyond that, all 1st hand experience and knowledge is steeped in symbolic meaning making
	- Metamodern
		- Primary characteristic is value qualitative development of human beings, developmental perspective that can accept and integrate partial truths of all value memes
		- God AND humanism is dead
		- has grand narrative but recognizes it is partially fiction
- **We live, essentially, in a retarded world. Not then, an evil world**
- Reductionism occurs when you out complex and out code your own depth and state
	- World appears too dead and indifferent, always mechanics beneath the wonder 
- "the new game of life looks a lot like this: whoever has mastered the most perspectives when she dies, wins"
-  We don't need to convince anyone, meta-modern will outcompete.
- “ontologically, metamodernism oscillated between the modern and postmodern. It oscillates between a modern enthusiasm and a postmodern irony, between hope and melancholy, between naïveté and knowingness, empathy and apathy, unity and plurality, totality and fragmentation, purity and ambiguity”

### Prologue
- Political meta modernism is the most important new ideology welcome
- Political intellectuals from Noam to Milton west these silly hands to look serious, I own up to the mask and fiction and play with it 
- Political metamodernism is a vision for a society of the future
	- Based on central insight **“kings road to a good future society is personal development and psychological growth** 
- three parts of political metamodernism
	- listening society, where everyone is seen or heard and welfare is emotional needs and psychological growth
	- Codevelopment, political thinking that keep ego, bias, and emotion in check by creating better dialogues
	- Nordic ideology, 6 new politics around defending citizens from new sources of subtle oppression
- author 
	- studied under Harvard guy who made MHC, model of hierarchical complexity
	- Has subtle background in adult life of tragedy and pervasive sadness
	- Author wrote most of this alone in Swiss alps with 3 hours of daily Meditation 
- This writing will probably cause some pain as challenges prevailing moral intuitions 
- Followers are bronze, informed critics silver, and spiritual adversaries of gold
### Intros 
- this book will teach you theory that if enough people understand will dramatically improve lived of coming generation
- **This is a warriors code for changing the world** 
- Politics means games of power
- Two kinds of common blindness 
	- Development blindness, fail to see developmental stages of human beings and societies ie argue all societies equally developed 
	- Inner dimensions blindness, fail to see subjective dimensions of life and how they shape society and reality 
- Part one of book is about metamodernism politics
- Part two is about human development
- This book is written with a metamodern philosophy 
	- Philosophy is defined as an engine of your mind that has 
		- How you view the world, what is real, ontology and epistemology 
		- Your place in it and self conception
		- What is right and wrong, ethics
- Metamodetnism is a kind of philosophy and developmental stage we can reach
- presenting new overarching perspective like this book requires breaking norms of academia and this book is new idea not derivative of some ideology or person
- “Science is a whore dressed up as a queen” And it is easily bought and sold on both sides of any argument, there is no scientific default
	- you can’t prove human rights are good, need arguments and sense
	- “if my mode of thinking is less wrong than you’d, my social theory is valuable”
		- labels from conservatives to libertarian are wrong to more nuanced perspective
- since this book questions your very sense of self, reality, and ethics, here are 3 tricks you might play to avoid considering the ideas
	- Specific plz, if context demand specifics to argue details or if specifics be confused cuz you needed context to make specifics meaningful 
	- The humble seeker - thrives in ambiguity and offended by certainty and systematized thoughts, this is the Nietzchean, Taoist, humanities student
	- Spiritual purity - attack speaker for not being spiritual and thinking too much, consider yourself wiser
- “metamodernism is the marriage of extreme irony with a deep unyielding sincerity”
	- Without irony, sincerity would arise suspicions
	- This guy will fuck my wife , but in pursuit of what “this is actually about: universal solidarity with all sentiment beings, from all perspectives”
## Part one the new political landscape
- the most important Marx like revolution is happening in the nordic countries within extreme level of order and fast progression of modern society values
- Progressive as concept often biases new values and left wing
- Nordic countries 
	- are at upper right for survival vs self expression and traditional vs secular rational values
	- Sweden is most secularists country with kids seriously starting work at 30, high gender equality
	- Main advantage is relative stable development in relatively favorable part of the world economic system while being close to the cultural center 
- It seems like modern secular are increasingly the rich and media dominate in the us and abroad
- Societal progress is when lasting conditions of stability and abundance change the everyday games of life like workplace, dating, neighborhoods etc 
- happiness surveys show income is linked to happiness logsrithmically
	- But happiness also linked to other things like health, income inequality, higher levels of trust so in rich countries happiness decoupled from wealth
- Nordic are post materialist challenging dominant role of work, support basic income, and emphasis on quality of life and social entrepreneurship 
	- To achieve these goals society must be qualitatively different then it is today
- A parties in Nordic are green social liberalism
	- The center is the winning underlying metamodernism ideology that both parties hug:
		- support for market economy , welfare state, liberal values and environment awareness
		- Gradual adaption to economic globalization with focus on growth, liberal markets, and international competitiveness 
		- 50-50 mix of public bureaucracy and private enterprise
	- this idealogy is superior to others under current economic, technological, sociopaychological, and historical circumstances
	- this ideology standstill is solid because
		- parties no longer represent real economic classes because can have a teacher, depressed person, and high income all in the same family
		- More left and socialized loses in international competition and more right loses key economic actors, less environmental loses moral high ground
- With both parties being very close, voting participation makes less sense and more of a desire for real codevelopment and real deliberation 
- Liberal democracy by approaching its ideals and dissolving class boundaries has made itself slowly obsolete with representation becoming weaker and need for deliberation increasing 
	- Not choosing leader with differing ideas but just better janitor at moving country along
### Chapter 2 crisis revolution
- populist movements on left and right both don’t realize we don’t live in national industrial society and resist immigration, globalization etc 
	- Left believes society faces attack by corporate greed but really post materialist values of happiness, quality of life, and self development are booming over materialism 
- new parties of changing times represent triple H: hipsters hackers and hippies
	- yoga bourgeoisie are rich urbanites that realize money is not the happy life and turn to yoga, yantra, contact improv, improv, self help couches and courses and burning man
	- Progressive are transnational and care about sustainability 
- progressive leans women and urban while unprogressive leans male and poor
- “The more artsy, creative, well connected, socially intelligent, emotionally developed, idealistic, digitized, diversified and educated you are- the more likely you are to be a rising star of the new society”
	- progressive att advantage in info age
- Triple h have unique worldview and skills, the creative class
	- Hackers are coders who also use social and cultural capital
	- Hipsters produce symbols that help us sense make in this digital world ie artists, writers, designers
		- Develop ideas of transhumance, movements, new gender relations through media and music and fashion
	- Hippies produce new lifestyles that make postindustrial society better
		- Less Crystal and more mediation and psychedelics, profound communication and sexuality etc
		- Highly educated and burning man core
	- All driven by intrinsic motivation, rely on cultural capital and less in economic capital
	- wage labor hinders their life so they often live outside the system
		- Revolving door between triple H and economically precarious lives with state and families supporting the failed ones
	 - **”If their higher aspirations fail, life seems to offer them very little and they are prone to falling into escapism and depression”**
	- Triple H suffer from extreme differences in response to their work, bullshit because of all the abstract ideas they deal with, and empty networking leading nowhere but they still need to do relying on large networks
- why does us have polarization instead of green social liberalism 2.0?
	- High A factor(authoritarian bend) is more predictive of being trump supporter than education, income, or gender
	- in us discontent for globalization and A factor combined in one party for polarization
		- But their programs have little to improve peoples lives  and can’t prevent globalization so will be more room for metamodernism in a decade
	- Swedish polled 9% for trump, so dominant other ideology
- we live in unprecedented time, Information Age of exponential growing info and compute 
	- Ai, nanotechnology, VR, transhumanism, EA, nuclear, iOS, big days, quantified self movement, blockchain, Syntheism, ecological disaster
	- demographic booms in Africa with China to India to developed countries being below replacement
- “at the micro sociological level, most humans are doing better then ever. Yet there is so much confusion, suffering, and bitter resentment. **How many beautiful privileged people have I not heard whisper to me, late at night, that if it were up to them, they would never have been born; that they are angry with the world; that they were let down; that they live with guilt and self doubt; that their friends and families are hypocrites? These are signs of alienation sufferered by modern humans”**
- millions of people are working on something that will change everything, and all these changes interact with each other
- What we need is open ended abstract direction, General ideas on how to act, stories about stories, meta narratives, social technologies
### In a nutshell
- politician metamodernism begins green social liberalism 2.0, social, libertarian, and green
	- basic idea is create deeper welfare system that creates more authentic and happy people
		- Generate conditions for thriving Not formula
- what are we trying to fix, what’s wrong?
	- Normal life is so demanding that we expand energy protecting ourselves and not reaching our full potential or making good decisions about what to prioritize
	- Solution: have 6 new forms of politics that will be in next book
- Should we make people happy?
	- Happiness pursuit more about suffocating misery and degradation, as challenges and pain past of happy life
	- About increasing autonomy, independence, high challenge and support 
- Should we be focusing on rich countries rather then poorest?
	- Can do both and richest in better psychological state can be better global citizens
- “People are hurt and afraid at a subtle psychological level - and are therefore self absorbed”
- Some say you need anxious citizens for society to keep function, keep working and buying, produce good media 
	- but this takes humans as a means and Nordic countries do function well
	- Rather misery prevents productive, economic, social development
		- Social work, health, unrest, crime
	- Not overprotection, but acceptance of suffering and life
- We should create happy society cause we care
- Happiness isn’t everything, but it’s not nothing
	- spirituality, existential development, and meaning important to
- happiness tends to transmit in networks, but so does lack of development as someone being a bad boss, misunderstanding family, abusive date hinders you
- listening society calls for slow, democratic reshaping of everything from schools and workplace to sex lives and worldview
- Metamodern activist takes responsibility for development of all citizens and their ignorance and sadness and take activism as moral obligation
	- how can you create conditions for flourishing?
	- how can you do this in democratic, non manipulative way?
		- at least, we should vote in direct democracy about how or when we are nudged
### Possible and necessary
- all citizens grow up healthy and emotionally developed is possible and necessary
- Cost of someone being a burden on criminal and family system vs productive citizen is massive, could be worth years of early teacher support
- **Everyone should get therapist growing up, learn to meditate and mindfulness, gym early, debate, year off to look for purpose, sex ed and relationship**
	- this would cause more and more gains over generations
- once you have green social liberal base there is no future vision, so ripe opportunity
- **our current problems are increasing social collective intelligence to manage increasing complexity, collective and personal meeting making now that we lack preset stories**
- as labor market and jobs change more rapidly, people need more support and that will create some meaningful jobs around grilling kids designing processes and spaces 
- cuz flow state and instrinic motivation essential in creative industry, listening society will be more productive
- everywhere you meet people who use drugs, existential emptiness, disconnect from family and friends, abusive relationships and divorce, anxiety and self doubt
	- “Most people don’t see it. They don’t recognize how brutish and cruel life is even in the most developed countries”
	- what if people had support
	- how can we fix transnational challenges if most people live in broken worlds 
- Meditation in schools has been shown to improve school results and psychological development
	- no study on second order effects
	- Mediation shown to reduce blood pressure, depression,0 increase info transfer, intelligence, creativity, self confidence, 
- can also give kids simpler talk therapy, run at Max heart rate, more nuts and berries, prosocial games, non sexual touch
- improve emotional intelligence is like self awareness, self regulation, social skills, empathy, motivation
	- seems trainable, interesting to explore
- Huge difference in social skills and easily learnable
- collective intelligence in terms of how well a group solves offend problems is not strongly correlated to iq but more about average social intelligence and group structure like communication, diversity, decision making
- Believe in the power of positive global feedback cycles improving life 
### The alternative
- process oriented political party is less about content and more about process of decisions
- The Alternative is a Danish political party where what is central is process
	- they do have platform of sustainable, entrepreneurship, and changing culture of political dialogue
	- Triple H and yoga bourgeois memes give this cultural capital power 
	- invite ordinary citizens into dialogue and deliberation in so called political labs 
	- Put culture first with six dogma of debate
- sensitive social entrepreneur is increasingly becoming the new ideal type in this economy
- political metamodernism is balancing of sincerity and irony that gives it marketing advantage 
- alternative is transnational as nation state can’t be primary block of goverance because there are problems and people increasingly beyond it
- new class of netocrats like people with great privilege and high personal development
	- “People who have somehow fallen outside of the normal meaning making process of everyday life-without breaking apart”
	- **enemies of the bourgeois lifestyle where you take your job very seriously but never seriously enough to change the world**
	- change the world by influence not leading
### Political philosophy
- **individual self is neat idea for unit of social organization but it’s an illusion**
	- **“all our wants, dreams, words, and ideas come from the social environment”**
	- No longer effective unit
- dividuals idea we are in fact all part of one another and affect one another
- Transpersonal perspective is we coemerge or intraact with one another but still have important inner lives
- like modern society scrapped rights of family for individual, we go for trans individuals 
- Terrorist emerges from society from a life of family, peers, labor, love, how do we make that less likely to occur
-  slight changes in behavior can change society
	- in simulation of rings and crosses, slight preference for moving towards own kind causes clear segregation
		- police’s could direct more attention towards minorities because they themselves are racist, or other people are more likely to call police, or cultural differences cause more misunderstandings thus escalate to violence more, or statically these areas and people do commit more crimes
	- Not villainous patriarchy or capitalism, no enemies just complexity
- no left right a prior thinking gov or market better, instead gov market and civil sphere of personal relationships all important in different areas
	- **genius of modernity is seperating spheres of life, economic and social and gov**
		- **you can have sex without economic relations, job without affecting or dependent on family, speak truth without punishment, gov without cronyism**
		- **but separating these spheres creates alienation**
		- **metamodern reintegrates the spheres like public private initiatives, social entrepreneurship** 
	- Social is fractal(repeating pattern) of solidarity/cooperation, trade, and competition 
		- friendship can be broken into competition and trade/gain too, war built on sacrifice and solidarity, birth love and competition
	- another triad seen as parts of metamodern whole: equality, freedom, and order
- “is it not obvious that whatever you think and believe today, it can’t be fully correct or acceptable from some future vantage point, where better knowledge is on the table?”
	- taking ourselves seriously is a sign of madness
- social and political systems are nonlinear, ie input doesn’t really relate to output
	- Instead of more money or education producing more understanding or freedom, social systems are ecosystem that selfregulate, maintain homestatis then crash through crisis
	- we can’t trust ourselves to know answers, but instead trust the process of conversation and dialectic
	- **“metamodern activists relentlessly make naive efforts to do great things, things that are unlikely to occur at each attempt, but almost certain to occur in the long run, somewhere, somehow”**
		- Live skillfully with uncertainty
		- (The best modern philosophy can handle uncertainty)
- Toxic liberal belief
	- There is a pure or correct ideology
		- Liberal democracy was never based on deliberation about common good or educated citizen, instead it was always trench party warfare/dialectic between competing interests
			- As society blurs class distinctions, this historical liberal democracy cancels itself as left and right blur 
		- “the truth is that you don’t have the truth; that you never will” 10/9/23 #quote 
			- “whatever direction you move in, it will lead to contradiction, self destruction, and decay sooner or later”
	- if you don’t act and just act normal, you are not responsible
		- partaking on our flawed society is being complicit in its crime
		- You are causing harm
		- Any true freedom, revolution is simultaneously a call to power, violence, and new winners and losers
## Part Two psychological development
### Chapter 7 on stage theories
- levels of adult development can be dangerous because we love knowing a ranking of people
- humans aren’t equal, stages of development are great lens to understand behaviors
- stages of development are cognitive development, cultural coding, state and depth
- **to avoid downsides of stages creating hierarchy, practice radical acceptance and know it’s not a moral hierarchy**
- stages aren’t age based, but equilibrium of self supporting balance within your mind, brain
- two types of development theories from specific like moral or leadership to general
	- Moral goes from preconvetial that is more selfish, conventional taking into account norms, and post conventional which reflects critically on norms
	- Pattern is going from black and white to nuisanced dialetic
		- first you get more differentiations then you integrate them
- 6 global theories of note
	- Keagan development of self perception
	- Loevingers personality development 
	- Grace spiral dynamics where people given colors and comes with cultural logic
	- Wilber’s where spiritual and cognitive development independent 
	- young’s neo piagetian 5 stage recurring 5cycle giving 25 stages
	- Lampreys model of hierarchical complexity(mhc) is most scientifically supported model analyzing solving problems of different complexity
- problem with these models is binding to many types of development, mhc at least get cognitive development as core type
### Chapter 8 Cognitive Development
- Micheal commons, creator of mhc, would randomly quiz people and guess things about them
- Mhc
	- Neopiagetan believing in piagetian model of cognitively stages, but including several states above what most achieve
- stages
	- Calculators stage(molecules)
		- 0 and 1 reaction with no room for strength
	- automatic stage (cells )
		- single stimulus response
	- Sensory or motor(amoeba)
		- Coordinate two stimulus response 
	- Circular sensory motor stage (insects, newborn)
		- Move after perceiving and recognizing objects
	- sensory motor (ray, small baby)
		- Series of movements to achieve 
		- Sounds to express
	- Nominal (pigeons, one year old)
		- Relation among concepts into words
	- sentential (2-3 years, parrots)
		- Sentences, sequence of tasks
	- Pre operational (3-5, dogs)
		- Simple deductions and stories/paragraphs
	- Primary stage(5-7, monkey)
		- Logical deduction, relation to times places, actors with several paragraphs
	- concrete stage (7-11, bonobo/chimps)
		- Roles and coordinate with others, interrelations, testing several tools
	- Abstract stage(11-14)
		- Abstract ideas, incrementally improve understanding of categories
	- Formal(14-18, 40% of adults)
		- algebra, self reflection language of if then 
	- systematic stage (18, 20% of adults)
		- Patterns among linear relationships, social structures and systems
	- Meta systematic stage (early 20s, 1.5%)
		- synthesize several systems with differing logic
	- Paradigmatic stage (mid 20s, 1 in thousand)
		- Several abstract meta systems to create new ways of thinking
		- Fractal way of thinking where universal principles are applicable to many different levels of analysis
	- Crossparadigmatic (late twenties)
		- Several paradigms to create new fields like Einstein theory of relativity 
- what is intelligence
	- horizontal complexity is speed of calculations and mostly what iq tests measure, 67% of iq score depends on mhc stage
	- Vertical complexity is what MHC measure
		- higher order actions contain and organize lower order actions
	- Super intelligent have high mhc and iq
- **mhc like iq 70% heritable and mostly fixed according to Micheal**
### Chapter 9, The important stages
- 90% of people fall in 10 abstract, 11 formal, 12 systematic, 13 meta systematic so you should learn to recognize them
	- 14 paradigmatic and 15 crossparadigmatic are rare
- complexity bias, means we prefer forms of reasoning at our level
	- Lower level seem crude, higher level seem vague or counterintuitive 
- If guided can create thoughts up to two levels above
- being at a stage means you display behaviors and cognitive operations of this order of complexity or below and only produce original thoughts/behavior this maximally complex
- Stage 10 abstract 
	- 11-14 only humans, 30% of modern pops 
	- 9 concrete, let’s you put together many different paragraphs into one overarching narrative
		- 9-10 in philosophy was everything is water to presocratics early 6th century BC
	- 10 invents own abstraction and variables/words, taken from concrete things like people and events
		- eg beyond furniture defining movable objects for rooms
	- narratives still matter but it’s a story about
	- cannot describe regular relations between different such abstract ideas, but can talk about it if other people do
		- Fail to see when to use the right variable so confused
	- tasks requiring 10
		- Writing conclusion tiring essay together
		- Pointing out common denominator in a few different stories
		- Inventing new words for things that aren’t concretely present
		- Driving a bus, rules object as body
		- Non investigative journalism
		- Teaching kids to read and write
	- Stage 10 political arguments
		- racism is bad. It is self contained essence that spreads if not stopped causing discrimination perhaps war
		- Arabic ness of arabica gives them traits irreconcilable with west
		- The less state control the better
	- Single variable, less immigration, more love, more dialogue
		- Not accounting for productive tradeoffs
	- repeating same argument when confronted with counter arguments 
- stage 11 formal
	- emerged at >14, 40% of modern pop, most common
	- understanding Newtons three laws requires 11, coordinating requires 12, and inventing it more
	- coordinating prices with demand, risk reward investments, etc
	- Invent our own rules or principles that describe or guide the relationship between several abstract variables
		- Behaviors guided by if this then that
	- 10 might think ruggedness is always bad, but 11 see it’s good when too steep so something to hold onto
	- Cannot relate several rules to form one coherent system of thought
		- MHC divisive point that many people can’t do this because it’s all feedback cycles/balance of two processes
			- it can be taught if someone else creates so we don’t notice
	- struggles with systematic issues like dirty kitchen has to do with shared kitchen
	- Tasks
		- write Conclusion that fruitfully compares to other texts
		- Patterns of plotlines
		- truck with multiple trailers
		- independent decision making medical work
		- Teaching kids to read and write with different methods depending on student
	- Political reasoning
		- Racism from economic and social inequalities and causes further
		- Cultural norms by Arabs may be irreconcilable 
		- The less state control the better except law and order 
	- linear plans about future, single if then principles 
- Stage 12 systematic
	- emerges in adults, 20% of pop 
	- Coordinate several formal rules to larger system, theory of evolution
	- most research, politician reason are stage 11 not here
	- Steepness, climber ability/size are complex set of variables because smaller arms better fit certain mountains etc, no definite rules
	- limited to think of one system at a time
		- main problem with adult development theories are most authors are at this stage
	- Tasks
		- Inventing new words for theories or literature genres
		- critical investigative journalism seeing cracks in systems
	- Politics
		- Racism emergent property of society interacting with inequality 
		- Challenges in reconciling west and Islamic culture depending on how categories interact rather than flaws inherent to either category
		- State control always has unwanted consequences so good to have low regulation
	- tend to have less rigid opinions but more rigid argumentation
		- Few rules of thumb and conclusion, but many factors
	- Tend to believe world consists of systems and their properties like economy, norms, evolution
- Stage 13 metasystematic
	- early 20s on, only 1.5%to2% of the population
	- comparing general properties of systems and when they generalize
	- Alignment between all the factors is what affects difficulty of climb
	- Alignability is the ease of changing a system into higher alignment,
		- so mountaineering low Alignability cuz hard to change climber/mountain 
		- market economy has high cuz so many variables
	- **politics**
		- **Racism emerged where ethnic markers used in status hierarchy emerging as different cultures and status hierarchy interact**
		- **liberal values more functional in late modern society than Islamic, but successful integration requires mutual understanding**
		- **state control interacts with other systems and is dependent on them for successful functioning so must be weighed and considered with markets, culture, and civil sphere**
- Wild most can’t create thoughts with feedback loops, catch22, or multiple linear variables
- Author noticed patterns in smart friends never above stage 10
- how rare it was for a new theory in sociology instead of just rehashing ideas
	- Top people in field come up with one new theory
		- Juergen Habermas since age 30 has long strong of novel ideas
- Downward assimilation means anyone can use complex words beyond their stage where for them it follows the logic of their own stage
	- imagine parrot talking about negative feedback loops
	- norms become social rules that create inequalities, identity means self confidence
- scaffolding means with right guidance can go up to stages higher
	- Common language stores patterns
- MHC Stage transition happened in 8 step transition where you gradually coordinate things
- stages implies hierarchy of profession, can avoid by saying there are just different types but don’t ignore the truth
### Chapter 10 Symbolic Development
- cognitive stage of individual is distinct from symbolic development ie language used
	- Cognitive stage is hardware and language is software
- “my claim in this chapter is that there is a stage difference between the various forms of cultural code available to people today, and that this stage difference follows a logic inherent to the meanings of the symbols and their interrelations, rather than being inherent to the cognitive stage of the specific organism”
	- “this stage difference follows a distinct dialectical logic”
- there is a evolutionary development of memes that progress on a path
- author wrote other book about hidden pattern in world history about meta memes, patterns that set logic for memes that show up
- The meta meme of secular modern life privates in 17th/18th century, but majority of world still in pre modern memes
	- But modern ideals have broken down and created post modernism
		- and postmodernism has created metamodernism
- 7 meta memes
	- Archaic, earliest humans, stage 7 per operational
	- animistic, magical and ritualistic thinking of tribal society, Stage 8 primary
	- Faustian, mythical thinking of agricultural warrior society, Stage 9 concrete
	- Post-Faustian, mythic-rational, transcendental thinking of rational, religious society, Stage 10 abstract
	- Modern, the rational, scientific thinking of the developed world today, Stage 11 formal
	- Post-Modern, the post rational, systemic critique of modern life and society, Stage 12 systematic
	- Metamodern, read this book, meta systematic
- **Each meta meme has (like agent in an arena)**
	- **An ontology, theory of reality and what’s real**
	- **An ideology, theory of what is right and good** 
	- **An identity, an idea of who or what the self is**
- while many different stories or religions, there is an underlying meta narrative to create new narratives
- Story of asking rural Uzbek “if bears in north are white and X is in north, what color are bears in X?”, answer was “Ive never seen one and can’t say but if someone older claimed to have seen one I would believe him”
	- valid empirically answer, live in different worlds of abstraction
- the code of each meta meme runs according to a specific MHC, meta modern is meta systematic about composing and composing knowledge across systems
	- Note mhc level of individual didn’t mean they are at meta meme level and you don’t have to be at level to use code you just run a simpler version
	- note content at stage can be massive vs code of meta memes, ie religious scholars were real genius 
	- If your at higher stage, then more likely to download a higher level as there are many meta memes  available in our society
- no this model doesnt imply there is a deterministic progression of thought
	- Just interruptible patterns that can play out very differently
### Chapter 11 The Symbol Stages
- first four symbol stages in his book The 6 Hidden Patterns of World History
- Stage A Archaic, before animistic Stone Age but post humans like us 70k years ago
	- few traces, buried dead, 
- Stage B Animistic, most cave art from 40k years on
	- magic, animism, spirit worship, nature lore
- Stage C, Faustian, agriculture
	- Like in faust, can sell your soul for ascension and power that is now possible over large lands, resources, and pops
	- many gods and heroes like Greek and Vikings
	- Concrete cause now can have longer narratives and have historians
- Stage D, Post-Faustian/Traditional
	- critique of "might makes right" of Faustian turns into classical religion 
	- from Taoism and Buddhism to Christianity and even Greek Socratic philosophy
		- all these abstract from stories, universal understanding, a god above the gods
		- **basic core is there is universal truth and reality beyond stories that we must ultimately surrender to**
	- “exit rebellion, violence, and power; enter surrender, peace, and harmony”
	- “Truth with capital T means rebellion is futile”, and devil is not demigod but source of evil and king is not authority but servant of truth
	- within agricultural society, “Create disciplined spiritual practices to develop the human soul towards realization of the ultimate truth“
	- **“there is always one true path set for us by the prophets”**
		- But open wound where people who disagree must either be wrong or stupid or you are
		- fight to defend ontology ie sense of reality, ideology ie sense of what a good society is, sense of self ie social construction of the ego
		- heretics worse than infidel cuz they know what you know and STILL betray it
	- in grasp for universality, ultimately punished deviance and creates justification for kings and bishops to rule
- E Modern
	- but if it’s universal, shouldn’t it be verifiable by everyone, or falsifiable
	- Materialism, reductionism. Positivism, determinism, and scientism 
	- Physics is reality, no ghost in the machine 
	- Forget prophets of opinion and historical contingencies, forget private revelations on silent retreats and bring forth public revelation that can be confirmed
	- objective uncaring reality which is real and exciting not a false lullaby, individual informed decisions and tolerance, besides pseudoscience though that crosses a line
- F postmodern
	- if “reality is based on intersubjective verifiability, shouldn’t all perspectives be included and get a voice?”
		- intersubjective verifications assumes individuals are distinct from environment, but what if context/grander systems affects peoples understanding
			- Common language, social hierarchies, prejudices and economic interests
	- modernity led huge human rights violations, colonization, women oppression, global warming
	- And is science really objective, it keeps changing from Newton to Einstein to quantum and most people can’t verify it
	- the world is phenomenological, meaning first and foremost your subjective experience and it didn’t get more objective
		- your experience of a chair or hydrogen atom is a social construct, symbols all the way down
	- **we thought we killed god, but we just hid it behind a belief in an objective reality** 
	- **we thought we abandoned the soul , but we just hid it in the individual with individual thoughts and free will that somehow exists beyond cultural environment in a deterministic universe**
	- belief smart are more deserving and you win by working hard in Reality
	- Michel Foucault is 1960s French philosophEr most representative of postmodernism, as well s as Dierda rejecting this end of history mindset
- Stage G: Metamodern
	- Metamodernism asks why such a strong rejection of modernism, grand narratives, and power hierarchies when it’s not an enemy but an early development stage that needs to be included in a universal value
	- sure you got social sciences like eco feminism and queer theory, but there is no real alternative version or science like scientific revolution
	- **Metamodern seeks a universal truth with deep sincere faith (postfaustian) that everyone can insolently agree on (modern) while finding all cracks and excluded voices in that story (postmodern)**
	- we should define what progress is and if social reality is constructed shouldn’t we construct a better one
- stage advancement invalidates everything previous stage holds dear
- each stage advancement requires higher mhc to be able to install, G meta modern requires meta systemic stage 13 so 98% will get condensed version
### Chapter 12 subjective states
- we have done two objective states of MHC and cultural programming, now we do the hardest thing of making a quantifiable scale for subjective states
- subjective experience lies at the heart of reality and must be of ultimate significance in life and society, and so truth and MHC only matter in how it affects this
- having subjective experience, being, implies you care and things matter. **All ethical value stems from qualitative differences in inner landscapes**
	- subjective experience can be transformed by spiritual, material, and more
- Don’t want just happiness, also want higher states of consciousness/clarity when reality reveals itself  lower states are when reality lacks wholeness
- **”We live in a screaming world. Because there is suffering untold, existence has us eternally by the balls. This inescapable, unyielding by-the-ballness is our predicament-to which there can ultimately be only one response: to care. The question, then, is only how we care.”**
- Scale that boldly combined it all, not equidistant so can’tadd or subtract
	- lower states
		- Hell 1
		- Horrific
		- Tortured
		- Tormented 4
	- Medium states
		- very uneasy 5
		- Uneasy, uncomfortable
		- Somewhat uneasy, okay, full of small faults 
		- Satisfied, well
		- Good, lively
		- Joyous, full of light, invigorated 10 10
	- High states
		- Vast grand open 11
		- blissful , saintly
		- Enlightened, spiritual unity 13
- states are more fundamental than emotions because organisms seek states rather than emotions
### Chapter 13 reaching higher
- unlike mhc stages, states aren’t built on top of but exclude other states and truly transformative 
- **“Spirituality is a catch all phrase for those human activities, experiences and practices which concern the three highest categories of subjective states — and the perspectives on life and the world that flow from such states”**
- “Low states are the ones in which the organism loses its will to live” where “even suicide may be too difficult”
- there is median states, average state where just 6 to 7 can be huge life difference and also consider state variability which is better for artists and those closer to higher states cuz more likely to go up and worse for rest
- while it is said depressed see world more clearly, author says higher states let you see world and your place without distortion of brokenness
- states easier to change then stages
- while lower states might be needed like in Jesus facing Devil, dark night of the soul in contemplative Christianity, and 
- having subjective experience, being, implies you care and things matter. All ethical value stems from qualitative differences in inner landscapes
	- subjective experience can be transformed by spiritual, material, and more

### Chapter 13 reaching higher
- unlike mhc stages, states aren’t built on top of but exclude other states and truly transformative 
- “Spirituality is a catch all phrase for those human activities, experiences and practices which concern the three highest categories of subjective states — and the perspectives on life and the world that flow from such states”
- “Low states are the ones in which the organism loses its will to live” where “even suicide may be too difficult”

- states easier to change then stages
- while lower states might be needed like in Jesus facing Devil, dark night of the soul in contemplative Christianity, and Tibetan Buddhism monsters, don’t idolize lower states
- enlightenment states are subjective so hard to study or prove to others, so we are very skeptical in modern society cuz they promise and proclaim something you have never experienced but it’s real
- **spiritual congregations where you devote yourself to an enlightened guru are actually a modern phenomenon, 19th and 20th century** 
	- many abuses of power including financial/sexual exploitation, violence, brainwashing
	- Sri Aurobindo, Osho, Adi ads, Andrew cohen, Anna, and chogyan trungpa 
		- All communities devolved
	- **problem is these communities have a hierarchy dependent on having higher subjective, ie unveriably, states so lie to yourself about having higher state and require personal interweaving**
		- Unlike traditional monestaries that are also about philosophy and service
### chapter 14 depth
- 4th dimension of development is depth, Stage like too
- depth is a persons intimate embodied acquaintance with subjective states, higher when you integrate higher states into your personality
	- ie spiritual wisdom
- greater depth people have experiences a wider range of states and can understand other people in those states, ie embodied knowledge of agony and ecstasy
- **“depth is a persons innermost recognition of the greatness and/or seriousness of reality”**
- good proxy can asking what they think is of ultimate significance, what is most important to you ie meaning of life without the baggage
	- low depth lack philosophy and just mention something they work on or think is important, or happiness, fun, success, good
	- Medium depth involve more universal answers like love, truth beauty, to prevent suffering
	- great depth involves universal values not necessarily corresponding to everyday life: to manifest divinity, find radical acceptance, surrender to God
		- tend to be religious in some sense, but so do people in traditional religions
- depth tends to be permanent
- experiencing different states needs to be integrated, trauma can cause positive psychological development and spiritual lineages deal with higher states
- spiritual masters have both high average state and great depth
- **"People who have trouble with integrating high spiritual states (by a 'Kundalini awakening' or similar) - often a messy affair - can be interpreted as being bipolar"**
	- **therapists should out-depth us and broken people often live in greater worlds**
- Three forms of inner depth, wordless relatedness to reality
	- Beauty
		- Purely subjective, beyond words, only known through direct experience, majesty, clarity, serenity, love
		- Can you look at telescope and be awe-inspired? "Beauty, in this sense, is a kind of recognition"
	- Mystery
		- a will to know for the sake of truth
		- What does it feel like to be Plato and discover universal truth?
			- Dawkins and Sagan describe this wonder and awe as a replacement for traditional religions
	- Tragedy
		- biggest diff between adult and child is awareness of suffering
		- **"to be spiritually mature means both accepting the unavoidability of suffering and being resolved to prevent and mitigate it"**
		- beyond war and death, all things that bloom will rot
		- your own children will be tortured
		- what comes from recognizing the tragedy?
			- "youniverse", I am nothing without you and love you fundamentally realize this, i must live in service of you and resolve to work against it despite the fundamental hopelessness and utter meaninglessness
		- **"only broken hearts can save the world"**
			- **"only a sense of tragedy can drive us to work for the wretched of the earth: loving until it hurts"**
### chapter 15 wisdom troubles
- there is light and dark depth for higher or lower states
	- **without dark depth can't understand the depressing insights of Schopenhauer and the Buddha, denial of tragedy**
	- **without light depth you get modern philosophy from Schopenhauer and existentialists which argues you can't achieve prolonged periods of higher subjective states b/c no spiritual practice**
- Being outdepthed sucks cuz either your goals are frivolous or you missed some greater meaning in life
- "The greater the depth a social setting seeks to accommodate, the more difficult the social situation is to manage smoothly and productively"
	- So institutions strive for lower depth giving impression it’s really only you
	- We pretend to have less depth then we do
	- We need to develop language and institutions allowing greater depth and differing depth
-  wisdom
	- checkout “evidence based wisdom”, “transformational learning”, “self leadership”
	- Wisdom as solution to society problems in general is overrated, or rather unclear how to operationalize
		- wisdom is seen as always good not tradeoff
		- wisdom defined as about treating others well, beyond materialism/selfishness
	- Author says wisdom is great depth or mental health, high complexity, and great depth
- **From Bertrand Russell’s biography, “What have I lived for? Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: The longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.” #quote** 
	- **“this has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered to me”**
### Chapter 16 effective value meme
- four development dimensions of complexity, code, state, and depth combine into effective value meme
	- Inspired by spiral dynamics(weird origins)about people developing through clear recognizable sequence of value memes, vMemes
- Spiral dynamics doesn’t work because it only has one dimension
	- purple(tribal), red(gang), blue(trad religion), orange(modern), green(postmodern), yellow(metamodern), turquoise(new agey)
	- 14 year old out codes Thomas of Aquino’s medieval genius, but Thomas outdepths, out complexes, and prob out states 
		- but spiral dynamics has kid as strictly better 
	- Vmeme improves as society more well off
		- South Korea modern but Israeli under war more trad
	- vmeme main insight is there is a real pattern of development ie new atheists doing hey why so many people are blue, it’s not dogmatism it’s development
- **effective value meme is a kind of average between complexity, code, state, and depth using same names as prev so: Archaic, animistic, Faustian, post Faustian, Modern, postmodern, metamodern**
	- later value memes are more functional in larger society and many problems in our world 
- “Our ways of seeing, sensing, feeling, acting, and understanding do not correspond to the very society that we ourselves have created. This glitch is lethal. And this is the issue of our age: to develop the political psychology of the world population”
	- there are pathologies and problems with development
- each of 4 dimensions has width
	- stage has IQ and other cognitive capacity
	- Code is much and quality of knowledge
	- State means length of time period in higher states
	- Depth is time spent and integration of variety
- so stage 13 metasystematic with stage E Modern code will have higher effective value meme than stage 10 abstract thinker with same code
- societies have gravity point where people gravitiate which is post Faustian for India/Iran and modern got US/France
- How state and depth affect
	- **High state and depth leads people to break with conventions of society like Jesus**
	- lower state and depth leads to lower men’s value like convict code, machismo etc
	- medium state and depth stay at average of society
	- higher state and depth haven’t really improved historically so not assigned to specific effective value memes
- symbolical stages are most obvious of the 4, but they are abstract logic while value meme is embodied behaviors
- Meta memes in his other book have same names as this and symbol stage but about patterns in development of society not individual like value meme
- **value memes, worldview is 1st I self, 2nd you right and wrong or ethics, 3rd view of what world is ontology**
	- Archaic 
		- 2 million years ago, no systematized value but only bodily and survival oriented
		- now in mentally disabled, feral, infants, extremely poor homeless
	- Animistic
		- 40k years ago with artwork
		- Anthropomorphic world of spirits and magic, 
		- Self, closely tied to your body and relationships
		- ethics, very concerned about social taboos as interests of small group overshadow individual
		- Semantic not different from natural so words are same as objects, things that sound alike are alike
		- Ontology, Mhc primary so many contradicting story stories
	- Faustian 
		- Neolithic with arrival of agriculture
		- ambivalent gods represent aspects of society above society and nature, first appearance of warlords and honor
		- Historically vikings, now in failed state like Somalia, organized crime, pagan or voodoo practices, hip hop
		- self, **“the self must find its destiny, ie which place the self has in the social hierarchy”**
			- self part of larger clan but can ascend through heroism
		- Ontology, MHC Concrete so stories of gods, heroes, "the first few paragraphs in Genesis directly contradict one another", but later are coherent
	- PostFaustian
		- Began in Axial Age 2.5k years ago with all major religion and most of human history
		- Unlike Faustian, Postfaustian is against war, killing, slavery, and oppression
		- Now most religious people, nationalists conservatives
		- self, around soul with morality beyond who you are and become more by serving higher truth as part of greater social whole
		- Ontology, Not interests of group but larger morality as world is second to eternal world of God
	- Modern
		- Dominant in modern society starting with French Enlightenment, proto form in Greece and pieces in Italian Renaissance
		- human rights where all people are created equal, democracy, og socialists (now more postmodern) progress, science, civil liberties, fair competition, rule of law
		- anthropocentric world with little care for animals or world
		- Self is individuals with right to express individuality in this world, think rationally as citizens
		- Ontology, scientific perspective can satisfy all human needs and reveal knowable truth through intersubjective verification as universe is purely materialistic
		- life is a game
	- Postmodern
		- started around beginning of 19th century with Kants critique of pure reason, German Romanticism, but really became mainstream after 1968 with critical sociology/lit studies student attempting to overthrow society especially in Paris
		- Gender equality, criticism of norms, environmentalism, critical nonmainstream thinking, animal rights, cultural relativism, fight power structures
		- "Doesn't believe in progress but rather that societies change over time"
		- Self defined in opposition to modern society and culture, instead of nature
			- Normal people are robots
			- Authenticity, especially of emotions, becomes important
				- Something real beyond modern society
			- "**Alienation makes you miserable so you have a pervasive sense that there must be something wrong: Is it the world, or me? Because we all need to maintain a positive self-image, we must conclude that the world is at fault rather than ourselves, and that we are somehow an exception from the world, hence not partaking in its badness."**
				- "If I am not better, at least I am different" - Rousseau #quote
		- Ontology, ultimate reality is Symbols structures and culture and we can't go beyond that, all 1st hand experience and knowledge is steeped in symbolic meaning making
	- Metamodern
		- New
		- Primary characteristic is value qualitative development of human beings, developmental perspective that can accept and integrate partial truths of all value memes
		- Not evil but developmentally challenged, retards not guilty. Even modern society
		- Second characteristic is that they value inner dimensions much more so seek authenticity and intimacy in work, mindfulness, democratic social innovations, philosophical and existential issues
		- Self is a "dividual", transpersonal self so often more controlled and transparent by one another than we are by ourselves
			- "We are just bodies and fictional stories; consciousness is transformable and all stories can be developed"
		- mission is to help humanity, stimulate development of stages and relations between stages
		- ontology, (this is weird, i dont get it) Realdialektik: History develops in certain directions for logical reasons, potentials and potentiality rather than facts and actuality are most fundamental. Perspective, physics, and consciousness are inextricably intertwined
		- Now pretty rare, but in arts like Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van der Akker, The Fountain, Her
			- Those who internalized postmodern memes, but also value inner growth and developmental perspective as social problems are rooted in core problems of our inner selves
		- accepts importance of elites and hierarchy, not all can be metamodern
### Chapter 17 Major Implications
- is there really nothing beyond metamodern? yes, b/c
	- no symbolic code available to murderously critique metamodern
	- rare, only understood by metasystematic less than 2% of pop and would require adults in stage 14 paradigmatic 1 in 1k and creation by super rare stage 15 and high depth
		- complexity scientists, adult development theories, post humanists, enactivists, Wilberian integralists. Maybe 4% but with right complexity and depth probably .5% to .1% of people are metamodern
	- "for a value meme to exist in any substantial sense, it has to have a social setting ie it has to define different institutions, organizations, or communities"
	- there are higher state and depth people especially around Zen retreats, so can be mistaken for something beyond but often not a complex thinker
	- beliefs in better will lead to deceit and cults cuz a lie
- increases in effective value meme is a increase in secularism, ie abstracting from direct experience and taking perceived world less at face value
	- modern isn’t fully secular, it has its own unanalyzed assumptions
	- Animistic goes beyond reality with how “spirits” influence world, Faustian goes beyond spirits to human gods creating society with might, postfaustian goes beyond human affairs to eternal higher god, modern goes beyond pure higher truth to method of inquire valuing universally verifiable truth, postmodern goes beyond pure rationality to recognize it as also biased by power structures, metamodern goes beyond evil power structures to emergent systems with reason
- no current metamodern movement but only metamodern can handle all other value memes productively
	- values most effective ones in postindustrial, internet society
- Dont just caricature of value memes, many types
	- faustian warrior with Greek Gods, aztec townsfolk, hardlife Bronx
	- PostFaustian monothesthic priest, teenage russian nationalist, eygptian housewife
	- modern shrewd businessman, atn rand, richard dawkins, frank sintra
	- postmodern a green peace activist, judith butler, arne naess, lady gaga, lisa simpson
- Light vs dark memes
	- high state/depth light vs high code/complexity with dark depth are very different
	- light promos are hippies with more universalistic and dark promos are academics who can better criticize society
- progressive if better then that time so same value meme for Jesus vs now is caused by retardation(developmental problems)
- **“We live, essentially, in a retarded world. Not then, an evil world”**
- magic residual occurs when people out depth and state their own complexity so they don’t understand and create magic
	- Visible in new age yogas who lean towards holistic magic, but also modern people belief in fate, loving heart heals others 
	- more common in people more advanced and harmful cause allows totalitarianism and incorrect thoughts can waste time and energy
- Reductionism occurs when you out complex and out code your own depth and state
	- World appears too dead and indifferent, always mechanics beneath the wonder 
	- Why not extract what you want from the dirt from dirt
		- happening on global level with environmentalism
	- more common in more advanced metameme people
- Nazism is modern state with Genghis Khan mental model, retarded developmental imbalance
- "relatively few people actually rewrite the code, actually change our faiths, worldview"
	- great philosophers form core of culture like Plato, Augustine, Marx, Voltaire 
	- need great depth and MHC to be a philosopher, mystic just great depth/state, scientist just great MHC/intellect
- Other adult development theories dont really work
	- Keagan 5 stages doesn't give us many specific ideas about development
	- Metamemes miss life phases, personality types, interests, emotional self knowledge
- "welfare was better than charity because it avoided some of the social degradation and power relations implicit to the latter"
- Author met young gifted 21 year old who has trained with Catholic priests and had a unmistakable softness in his eyes, an idealism not even in most idealistic animal rights activists
	- The only other person with the same sparkle was Jonas, a 25 year old who after talking with author said he had found a new hope, he killed himself a few months later
- better world requires we all grow in complexity, code, state, and depth, but depth is most unproblematic as others implying changing for what world needs
- "A happier world is probably a saner world"
### Development Matters!
- Nordic countries progressed more because it was explicit plan of founder of Swedish Social Democracy, Hjalmar Branting
- Compared to modern/postmo, metamodern has sustanability ingrained, integrates different cultures, propose path forward of developing people
	- and modern/postmo hate metamodern, brings back hierarchy but wins the argument
		- metamodern bring back hillbilly perspective and terrorist perspectives as valuable and postmos attacking from elitist postion of privelege that alienates
		- postmo struggles to find meaning and moral in dark world, and metamo shows up to counter it
	- **"our society can and will crash if people don't actively and consciously manage all the existing value memes: from animistic to metamodern"**
	- "the new game of life looks a lot like this: whoever has mastered the most perspectives when she dies, wins"
		- more people then ever have different value memes
	- metamodernists defining themselves by complex thinking not right or left meaning they are less appalling to all other value memes and thus have outsized impact
- we do not need to convince anyone, metamodern will outcompete others
### Appendix: Metamodernism
- Three meanings of metamodernism
	- a cultural phase, zeitgeist, like romantic period or enlightenment
	- a developmental stage, stage is distinct from phase theories because implies grater qualitiative shift 
	- philosophical paradigm, Hanzi Freinacht and other related philosophers
- Metamodernism defined/condensed
	- View on Life
		- exquisitely ironic and sincere
		- extremely idealistic and Machiavellian
		- God AND humanism is dead
		- interconnectedness and impermance
		- "normal, bourgeois life and its associated normality and professional identity as insufficiently manifesting the greatness and beauty of existence"
		- accept paradoxical nature of society
			- left and right, historical individuals and social structures, objective science and subjective experience, cooperation and competition, extreme secularism and sincere spirtuality, systematizing philosophy like plato and process oriented/open ones like Nietzche
	- View of Science
		- science is imporant, but contextual and reality always holds deeper truths
		- nonlinearity, suspcious of mechanical models/linear causation
		- insight in all stages of development
		- things are alive and self organizing because they are falling apart
		- we need overarchign story of the world
			- metamodernism has grand narrative but recognizes it is partially fiction
	- View of reality, spirituality
		- "to support a democratic, intersubjective, particiatory, scientifically supported, peer-topeer created spiritiuality, rather than traditional paths, teachers, gurus, or authorities
		- Darwinian evolution of memes and genes
		- explore panpsychism, consciousness is everywhere in universe, and mysticism/religions seriously
		- "Spiritiualliyt and nonspiritiuality: neither is inherently better than the other"
		- people are fundamentally crazy, our consciousnesss is insane
		- "intuit that the central spiritual and existential insight is the perfection of absolute totality as it always-already is; that there is a pristine serene clarity underneath all the chaos and contradiciton"
	- View of society
		- history has directionality
		- tehnology is not netural
		- sexuality overlooked centerpiece in understanding society, "Sexuality has extraordinary explanatory, behavioral and predictive power"
		- humans cognitive category, can include ecology/animals
	- View of humans
		- ego is not self/identity
		- "consciousness is transformable by changing her fundamental sense of self and sense of reality"
			- ontology (real), ideology(right), and self(ones own place)
		- Human is a dividual, animal born through interactions with people
			- subconscious, conscious, and supraconscious, higher intellect like universal love
		- transhumanism
- though metamodernism is a philosophy, this book is political instead 
- modernism is what you get in secular western society, postmodernism challenges this view by being anti progress, grand narratives, postmodern art plays ai the idea of art as everything becomes a mixing of styles 
- “ontologically, metamodernism oscillated between the modern and postmodern. It oscillates between a modern enthusiasm and a postmodern irony, between hope and melancholy, between naïveté and knowingness, empathy and apathy, unity and plurality, totality and fragmentation, purity and ambiguity”
	- keep skepticism but bring in modern hope and sense of direction, informed naivety, magical realism, and pragmatic romanticism
	-  Check out blog, notes on metamodernism
- author says other metamodern scholars don’t properly put forward visions of progress and development
	- author knows he is stealinng the term metamodern and adding more meaning to it
## Review
This book has probably the best intellectual content of any book I've read. Beyond conveying deep philosophical insights, this book proclaims and supports a model for human progress and one of the few optimistic visions of the future. It really impacted me. All at once, this book has deeply changed how I understand my life philosophy, personal development, theory of change, and people. Recently, someone asked what my life philosophy is, and I said "metamodern." And this book felt real. Some passages deeply resonated with me, especially about the suffering in the world. It wasn't perfect, though; it starts slow, and is a tad lengthy and over-explained at certain points. Despite the simple, clear language and important ideas, I found this book rather hard to get through. It also seems to idolize the Nordic countries a little too much. But overall, for being at its core a political philosophy book, it offers an accessible understanding of some pretty complex, comprehensive ideas. This book won't be my top recommendation, but I will probably be talking about its ideas for years.

Quotes:
- “At the micro sociological level, most humans are doing better then ever. Yet there is so much confusion, suffering, and bitter resentment. How many beautiful privileged people have I not heard whisper to me, late at night, that if it were up to them, they would never have been born; that they are angry with the world; that they were let down; that they live with guilt and self doubt; that their friends and families are hypocrites? These are signs of alienation sufferered by modern humans”
- “metamodern activists relentlessly make naive efforts to do great things, things that are unlikely to occur at each attempt, but almost certain to occur in the long run, somewhere, somehow”
- “the truth is that you don’t have the truth; that you never will”
- Metamodern seeks a universal truth with deep sincere faith (postfaustian) that everyone can insolently agree on (modern) while finding all cracks and excluded voices in that story (postmodern)

### Review Drafts
- review 	- believe it or it cried multiple times while reading this book. The description of just all these broken people you meet all the time. 
	- A tad lengthy and wordy at certain points, but overall this book offers a pretty complex, comprehensive understanding in simple language so perhaps worth it
	- One of the few books with an optimistic vision of the future. A model of human development both culture and philosophical. It seems to me to idolize the Nordic countries a little too much, but whatever. A little lengthy at times but for being a political philosophy book it does communicate well. I'm still not sure how to use this model. It gives a model that teases out differences between different types of development and stage changes between models and the importance of being open minded about the progression. Specific ideas resonated with me deeply, especially about the suffering and sadness in the world.
- This book has probably the most insightful intellectual breadth I have ever read. While drawing from deep philosophical insights, this book boldly goes beyond that to proclaim and support a model for human progress and one of the few optimistic visions of the future. And it really impacted me. All at once this book has deeply changed the way I understand life philosophies, my personal development, my theory of change, and people. Recently someone asked my life philosophy and I said metamodern. And this book felt real. Some passages deeply resonated with me, especially about the suffering and sadness in the world. It wasn't perfect though; it starts slow, and is tad lengthy and over explained at certain points. Despite the simple clear language and important ideas, I found this book rather hard to get through taking almost a year. It also seems to me to idolize the Nordic countries a little too much. But overall for being at its core a political philosophy book, it is able to accessible understanding of some pretty complex, comprehensive ideas. This book won't be my top recommendation, but I will probably be talking about its ideas for years.
two things that stand out. All perspectives are ok given a time and place, just different developmental stages. And those kids who died, the people behind closed doors.

When asked what I am recently, I said "metamodern" I'm still not really good at explaining it, but it seems to me to be the most advanced stage of thought

- the most optimistic book i've probably read ever because it has a real plan for the future
- was a clear, simple read but draggged on at parts and overexplained. The ideas are worth the struggle though.
