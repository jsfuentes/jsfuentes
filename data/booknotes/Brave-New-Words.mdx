- Money poured into tutoring did little
- khanmigo for free prevented pandemic slide and actually improved on pre pandemic

- his father prob depressed
- He went to MIT and had high status professors, went to analysts as hedge fund which he liked about learning about world 
- he always wanted to start a school
- education and healthcare where profit not same as value
- Like foundations for large time scales thinking
	- Culture and know how is where best are
	- Khan Academy could be institution’s built on internet to educate billions for centuries to come
- every level of labor will be disrupted from bottom to top, need to let everyone work at the top with ai enhancing skills
- people with time but no purpose or meaning susceptible to populism,

## Review
This is basically an ad for Khanmigo—more a vehicle of change convincing educators than a source of truth. But it is probably the most comprehensive vision and discussion of AI's impact on education, so still worth the short read. Khan paints a glorious future where Khanmigo is always there to help students, teachers, and parents, redefining the way we do everything from testing to recruiting. I do appreciate his underlying optimism for the future and Khanmigo's team carefully considering potential risks. But he so adamantly asserts teachers will not be replaced that it feels like he is just trying to soothe his future users. In one paragraph, he insists teachers will never be replaced, for they motivate learning with a personal connection. But in another, he praises AI's ability to do mental health coaching, noting we should start talking about AE (Artificial Emotion). It seems like AE can progress to form this personal connection, especially since children anthropomorphize everything already. This seems to me to be the biggest risk with AI in education—replacing children's real social connection and skills for the sake of knowledge in an AI-driven world where the opposite trade makes sense.  
  
Key Quotes:  
“This is not a drill, the AI tsunami is here to stay.”  
“Is Khanmigo a replacement for a teacher? No, and it never will be.” “Teachers will always be in command of their classes and thank goodness for that.” “Technology augments the motivation that a relationship with an adult gives them.” “There is no job that is safer in LLM world than teaching.”

==================
This is basically an ad for Khanmigo. More a vehicle of change convincing educators then a source of truth. Khan asserts in multiple places teachers will not be replaced. He does not bother supporting this. Claim. Probably imagining his listener will be very sympathetic. On the one hand he says teachers will never be replaced. In another paragraph he talks about how AI has unique EQ to relate and form relationships with people. It's unclear to me how that will not serve as a replacement for the motivation that you create. But it is probably the most comprehensive vision and discussion of AI's impact on education, so still worth the short read. Khan paints the glorious future where Khanmigo is always there to help. It does He even covers how AI will affect recruiting and job search, parents, jobs. But he also has this underlying optimism that almost feels like an ad for Khanmigo. In some places, I just disagree. He seems extremely adamant that teachers will not be replaced—almost too adamant. It feels like something you need to tell teachers to have them use AI. So really, this book is just a vehicle of change rather than a source of truth.

This book is an ad. 

Good book, Relativity Quick Read, Sam Khan. Covers the main use cases in education, going from AI teacher and recruiting to job search. But he also just has this underlying optimism. It almost feels like an ad for Ken Migo. In some places, I just disagree. He seems extremely adamant that teachers will not be replaced. It's almost too adamant. It feels like it's something you need to tell teachers to have them use AI. So really, this book is just a vehicle of change rather than a source of truth. 

they heard x complete so they thought about and implemented why did y solve x I don't know

Review: pessimistic take, what a long as for khanmigo. It has upside and solves downsides. No teachers will NEVEr be replaced and thank god. 

Optimistic take: 
This must be done and it’s nice he addresses potential containment and argues the steps he takes against them. Ai is the future with real upside and can’t be ignored

I appreciate Sam s optimism and hope for the future, less bias and good outcomes

3/5 Cuz I disagree and believe he is circumnavigating the truth and to a certain about the future to certain that teachers will not be replaced because that's what you need to tell them to use your product. probably the best source of information for AI in education, but there isnt many.

3/5 Im skeptical of his optimism, but appreciate it.
