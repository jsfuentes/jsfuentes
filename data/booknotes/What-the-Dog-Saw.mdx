title: 'What the Dog Saw'
---

Chapter 1

Theory of mind. Other people don’t think about what you do. So what does it feel like to be a doctor? We know what a doctor does

Section 1

Minor geniuses

Section 2

Theories of organizing experience

Section 3

People judgments

What do people who think about X think about X? What evidence did Bush actually have? When the dog whisperer comforts a dog, what he wonders is what the dog saw. Trick or challenge is to believe everything is interesting. People in the middle do the work, people at the top are self conscious and so not interesting. “Good writing does not succeed or fail based on ability to persuade, succeeds or fails based on it ability to engage you, make you think, see into someone’s else head.

Conquer of American kitchen

Popeel brothers dominate making random kitchen usage. One made an indoor smoked chicken machine and made a billion. pitched in flea markets and made lots of money. You can turn a pitch man into an actor but not an actor into a pitchman. You have to entertain and the do a turn into asking for money. Talk to 50, 25 buy, sell to 20 but keep 5 engaged while you start a new pitch serving as core of next group to start frenzy. Have pineapple that he promises to cut, but never cut it. Veggiemact could go through so much produce processing that it would cost so much to pitch it to crowd of 50 needed 50000 or tv. One of first to pitch on tv. 2500 sold in 5 weeks with 500 dollars in ad in small town. TV focused eyes making product star. Make glass clear and chicken rotating welllit. If he made a vcr, it would big loud and you could see tape through it playing. QVC would want to sell 37k machines so 4.5M in one day with Ron selling chicken make, showtime. Ron sold 1M in the first hour.

The ketchup condrum

Early 70s grey poupon. Significant taste test showed of mustard, one taste to switch from yellow mustard. Fancy in airport packets. 40-50% jumps when you show ad of rolls Royce suited guy asks Butler for grey poupon. Costs more. Now there’s a mustard section. Worlds best ketchup 3 times they cost trying to do for ketchup what grey poupon did for mustard. Pepsi trying to find perfect level of sweetness but the focus group didn’t have a good answer. Guy thought there were multiple perfections. Everyone had different preference for spaghetti sauce , three preferences groups plain, spicy, and extra chunky. There was no extra chunky in categories and was worth hundreds of millions. Now brands come much more in different varieties notplantonic spaghetti sauce. World best struggling. For different sauces, 70 rating for one group if you want to appeal to everyone best you can get is 60. Tomato was brought by Cortez, biggest producer is now China. You could see world history by looking at tomato. Umami is body, sensory heft. Turn sauce or soup into something that feels like a food. Baby wants umami or sugar in food way more. Ketchup hits all five senses. Heinz went in rooms and saw toddlers eat 60% more ketchup than 40 year old. Can control ketchup as a toddler. Easy squeeze increases consumption by 12%. Generic ketchup and colas have Sensory attribute you can single out and ultimately tire of. Worlds best has a lower amplitude and not as sensory complete, more like a sauce. Ragu has 26 flavors of spaghetti sauce.

Blowing up how talem turned inevitably of disaster into an investment strategy

Buffet was success for a reason right. Doris had theory of reflective. Or is this just post rationalization. 10k managers and half make money and half lose money. After 10 years, 9 would make money every year. Talem has small apartment floor for trading with like 4 traders and some kids, empirica name of firm. Trades options. Could gamble heavily on bonds, mortgages, or whatever. Based on idea this risk could be quantified. Quants, PhD. Like insurance of life with bell curve, but these guys believe stock market not like mortality at all. But these kids say long term capital management is a fail and happens very often. Rules change all the time like Russia defaulting on bonds. Black swan random unexpected event. He buys options on both sides and buys huge options on huge movements because they obviously undervalued. Rest in treasury bills. Karl popper said you can’t know a statement is true only that’s it’s untrue. Traders come in everyday to trade and follow news and the latest figures. Options selected by computer, wait and think. Talem turns around trading, day to day traders can make a small amount of money or if market crashes lose a good amount. Talem loses a small amount but one day could make a huge amount. We are risk averse when it comes to our gains. Emprica has basically lost money everyday making back only 40-80% per day. They can’t blow up, only bleed to death. Exactly what humans programmed to ignore. No feedback, feels bad. Key is not having good idea but have way to deal with idea, make protocol for all events. Got throat cancer while young not smoking? One in a hundred thousand, black swan to remind him. One hedge funds did naked put on making a small amount of money then Mary created 8# in a day and was ruined. Talem mentor. Nikarhoffer. Make shit ton in 2008 now trading billions.

True colors, hair die in postwar America

Girl died hair blonde since 16 and had flamboyant, strong personality wearing three outfits and believed she got to choose her hair color not god. Blonde for her constructed personality. Nice and easy, cream and bleach.” If only one life, live it as a blonde”. Hair like lipstick. Billionaire dollar. Reagan to carter, hair color mattered. 1950s and 70s got pill entered workplace and got hair dye. “Does she or doesn’t she” got more girls next door. A little Pettier than your wife and a slightly nicer house. Always had mother and daughter with same hair color, because not just fast women. pollicof , hair dye women, didn’t think women should make more than husbands. Two weeks as housewife, career oriented. Looking part without being part. George got travel ideas from reading times, faking it. Does she or doesn’t she was can you know who she is to. Feminist, housewife? L’Oréal had ad designed by a young women about how she spent more on L’Oréal not cuz she was rich but because she wanted full body hair and because “I’m worth it” made phrase for whole company. 71% women US recognize which is unprecedented by slogan. All L’Oréal women blonde, but certain type. 5 blonde types. By 60s not about getting the guy, but because women are worth it. Motivational research, before had been about counting head, now about why they do. Focus group invented. Prove you could add message to the brand and as much part of it lives as it emotions. Revolution need to be accessible, tangible, and replicable. Because I’m worth it revolution because it is a commercial attached to a product, something tangible changes. Has huge basket of divorced women who changed themselves and their hair. Over the counter ethnicity.

Chapter 6 what inventor of birth control pill didn’t know about women’s health

One of the inventors was religious and went every Sunday. Straight posture and face of reputation of pill. Pope John Paul outlawed it in 1960s. John rock believe pill was natural form of birth control. Progesterone is nature’s conceptive and surged after a previous ovulation to time it naturally. 1951 pope likes rhythm period by only having sec during safe period. John Rock felt pill was natural just like rhythm and made the cycle 4 weeks to not block natural mensturating. Some girl visited one of those tribes still living like their ancestors to try to learn natural cycles.. Menstruating huts on edge of village for 3 women. She charted everyone who visited huts for 2 years. Women first period 16 and to 20 averages 7 a year. From 20 to 34 averages a period a year because so much time spent pregnant or breastfeeding. 34to 40 4 a year about 100 times in their lives. Modern women menstruated 400 times. Virtually universal this was the history and stupid to think insistent ovulation is natural. Overweight and athletes not mensturating is indication of problem, but ovulation in general increases risk of ovarian cancer. Pregnancy lowers risk of Iberian cancer because mensturation causes healing so cell division so cancer risk. Headaches, bloating, inflammation, pain. All to pretend pill is natural. Brock preserving menstruatal regime is a modern figment, could reverse to historical by blocking menstruating. Breast cancer seemed to affect less Japanese women, but not when they came to US. Studying saw breast cancer rises in 30 and 40s than drop and ovaries removed had much less cancer, so could be about estrogen and prostegone. American women started at 14 and Japanese at 16(nutrition)that alone accounted for 40% of cancer diff. Japanese weight 100lbs and American 145lbs another 25%. Japenese women produced less estrogen. On American diet gained weight and estrogen. So pill is powerful anti breast cancer drug right. But in breast cancer progesterone also causes divides in breast so pill better for ovarian cancer but not breast cancer. Pike proposes drug that isn’t natural to actually be anti breast cancer. Balance pharmeticual company working on this. Start at 15 end at 45, Risk of breast cancer drops by half if you take this for 10 years and practically makes your breast younger by reducing cell division. 1963 Vatican and planned parenthood met and group re-examined position. It seemed rock was winning , but Paul the 6th delayed and said all artificial methods were missed. Maybe rock had wrong argument could be about saving life rather than preventing. 70s and 80s birth control users fell by half on claims of blood clots and rock was poor.

Chapter 7 what the dog saw, cessation Milan and the movements of mastery

Mexican. Caesar uses his hand to bite dog. In 5 minutes, will take usually wild dog and biting dog. Learned what he does in a farm, takes problem dogs into pack for minimum of 2 weeks. Every needs to stay calm and submissive. Need presence as teacher. Dogs recognize human movement, cares about where you body leans or breath. Humans can unwillingly signal tension when they meet other dogs. When two dogs meet also care about how owners look. Great phrasing is body language and tone, Cesar is dancing as he talks. Bill Clinton our Reagan had great phrasing, Bush doesn’t. Great phrasing people we love because we get the message, words emotional and authentic. Uses strength without being aggressive, not completely dominant but loss structure. You meet people where they are, not command attention with loud personality. Presence is reactive. Dogs need exercise, discipline, and affection. Ceasar didn’t understand people, lightbulb went off that to succeed he couldn’t just be dog whisperer.

Chapter 9 Enron

2006, schilling ran Enron received  24 years in prison, one of largest white collar convictions. Someone once ran one of Fortune 10 countries. Enron did mark to market accounting, for financial trades in like 10 years like an oil future where when the contract is realized could be profit or loss. What you do is mark the contact with its current price as revenue. In 2000, going through financial statements showed Enron was actually losing money if you don’t count these things. This was in public documents. Schilling was persecuted for lying, but its was in public documents. It did do shadowy side deals where it spins up a company and gets investment and loans that would depend on Enron’s investment. Don’t have to put that debt on balance sheet, Enron went further backing loan with its own stock and get less then reiable assets . This tangible ended up causing the demise. Enron did disclosed them, 3000 of these spes. It is very very complicated. Deals were so complex, even the board members there that discussed and made them probably couldn’t understand risks and consequences. Disclosed so much, information overload made it impossible to understand. Just summarizing would leave out details.

Germany superweapon! Propaganda analysts listened to all propaganda then decided how they felt. How often did they lie? How often did public expect outcome when something was said? Every prediction turned out to be true about the German super weapon the v1 rocket including launch dates and setback dates. 81% accurate. With tons of into now,you need more batty geniuses observing nation understanding culture and language and less spies. Financial info needs  transition too, financial intermidaters who understand the company and parse it. Watergate was broken though persistence and energy (youth), mysteries need experience and insight like Enron. Spread the blame for Enron. One Cornell class did a report on Enron saying their strategy was very risky and to sell before it became a thing.

Chapter 10: why homelessness may be easier to solve than to manage

Homeless guy in Reno. Go though Reno and down unfinished drinks. Cheap alg. Could picked up multiple times a day. One police officer picked up this guy his whole career. Panhandling stopped usually money for liquor because Reno has good food and housing for homeless. Murray ran up like 1 million dollars across his 10 years of hospital bills and police work. 1986 and 1990 police allegations weren’t bell curve but power law. If you thought bell curve, you would try to raise curve. Homeless. Most homeless transitory, not normal distribution. 80% most common length is one day and come back. 20% would often come back often and young and drugged. 10% is this group of perpetual chronic homeless. 62 M just for 2500 hardcore homeless with medical bills and such in New York. It’s a few hard cases. Might be cheaper for extreme cases to get someone a house and personal nurse them constant infection and lung damage and intensive care. 10:1 ratio with 10k cost per client per year. In contact every couple day or day. Denver is kinda 4.5k apartment or 15k a year which is a 3rd what they cost on the street. Can be stabilized. Power law homeless policy looks like allowing dependency on the system. But there are people working thheee jobs who don’t get an apartment. Giving apartment is efficient. Usually welfare is given to all who meet basic creteria, universality. Shelter and soup kitchen for all don’t solve homelessness. 5% of cars are 55% pollution as engine problems as you age can vastly increase pollution. Suggests mobile testing as they drive. Why make everyone do something that only affects small amount that could be avoided and pollution is sporadic. But that’s not the way we deal with collective environmental problem. Where a regulation that passes affects everyone. Problem isn’t policy but compliance. These policies don’t appeal to right because special treatment for those that don’t deserve it and left don’t like it because chooses efficiency over fairness.

Chapter 11: the picture problem, monographs, AirPower, and the limits of looking

Us gulf war strike jets to try to destroy middles at Israel. Launched from trucks randomly pathed in huge desert. On launch, find target with 4.6 M infrared photo. They counted targets killed, photo can’t lie they thought trusted more then their own eyes. Team to find actual efficiency, actual number of definite kills was 0. Pilot 6 in screen to find and have 5 minutes with interpretation. number were actually decoys. Others were tanker trucks. Picture can actually be confusing. Rodney king video launched riots and also basis of acquittal. Monogram to find tumors in breast cancer. Too much faith? Looking for little white flecks of calcium deposits. Many beign. Some definite yes or no, but most is unclear. Breast doesn’t have anatomy, many unusual. Showing mamograms to 10 doctors one got 85%, one got 38%, and very varying. False negative increases as correct. Can get better, but trade off inherent. 9 out of 1k 60 year woman will die in the next ten years. With mamogram with be 6 out of 1k deaths. With 10k tests over a decade, save 3 lives with most generous estimate of effectiveness of mamograms. Most are normal. Dense more absorbed so more white. Fat black. Thick breast tissue especially of younger woman is light gray or white. Cancer also white, so can miss some cancer in dense part of breast. Slow tumor throw more calcium deposits to be seen in mammogram, so picks up less dangerous ones. A study had 270 picked up from mamograms of most 70% slow , 150 missed. Majority Cancer found lump manually even with regular mamograms. 2x to be in stage three and high mitosis chance. Mammogram 3 year must be supplantment with through breast exam. Collarbone to rib cage one dime sized area at a time from three levels of pressure just below skin, mid breast, and up against chest wall not less than 5 minutes per breast. No difference found in one study when just breast exams. Nothing as close to touch worth range of stimula, but we trust visual more. WW1 bothering was just random because so difficult with 10k up, wind, plane speed, pick and yaw. WW2 got computer with gears to figure it all out 1.5 B, half amount of atomic bomb. What strategic targets in Germany economy, ball bearing factories because crucial to planes. Hitting ball bearing didn’t hurt Germany as machinery was pretty hardy and great stores. Even if they were hit. Maybe we miss understand how some cancers work that’s not dangerous like some in a duct that has milk. We don’t know though if it will grow. Tumor size less important then we think. Meta sizing more dangerous, spreading. We currently see any tumor and remove any tumor, but some can be know early on if it’s a problem. Genetic too. 50-60 critical range of breast. Mamogram gets about 10% reduction of breast cancer so average women in 50 3 extra days of life, wearing bicycle helmet on 10 hour bicycle trip.satellite images used to support Iraq invasion. See truck and box building from above lol.

Chapter 12 Should a Charge of Plagarism ruin your life

Serial killers almost all experienced harrowing physical and sexual abuse as children and have some brain injury or mental illness. Frozen on Broadway about serial killer and biography about this eminent studied of serial killer. So many similarities to her life and experience she had, like from her biography. 12 instances of passages from a New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell, said as inspiration for play. Plagarism almost seen as crime now in academia, historian asked to resign from Pulitzer Prize committee. Ip law’s strength. A savory writer would have changed references to obfuscate not exact quotes, but wouldn’t that be worse for everyone how is it better for her to hide inspiration. Robbed? Gladwell didn’t feel robbed but like his words of something larger. Stories ran ruin this playwright career for turning New Yorker article to something wild. Even asked about they said some article. Rap song has two rights, recording for performance and underlying composition. 6 second clip of performance in beastly boy song, recording permission gotten and composition sued but didn’t work because only was 3 notes. If copy someone that is copying someone, not illegal.  Not that you copied, as public domain is fine. It’s an incentive. Congress getting to much about just copying as US opposes some global laws because not about protecting profits but sanctity of IP. In literature, copying is never accepted. 100 of examples of plagiarism in artist and made better to make much more popular. Yes play write copied and from much more than the article with each character taken from somewhere , but why and what’s the benefit and cost. She thought it wouldn’t matter and actually connected with some mother with a very similar killer story to tell her and thank her. She copied many sentences, but not musing or conclusions. Often articles steal idea of story and structure from other newspaper, but if they just copied words it would be fireable as originality enforced on level of sentence. Affair is climax in play, mad she changed it. Upset about art creating something new not stealing.

chapter 13 connecting the dots, the parties of intelligence reform

Jordan and Eygpt just started building up military and Soviet Union airlifting people and navy on the move. Isreal is war eminent. One advisor said no and caught by surprise. Seems obvious right  if you go back from day. But if you start years ago and move forward with order different picture. Countries often look like they going to war. Egypt president once said attack was eminent, nothing happened. Isreal deployed 19 times without going to war, and deploying could even cause war. 9/11 often seen as complete failure of us intelligence. Seems obvious if you just list everything Us knew. Connect the dots. Pattern if they looked. Ask people to predict, and then watch what happens. Ask them what they predicted and they will always remember being closer to the answer. Creeping determinism. Unexpected becomes expected. Once a leader called they subordinate in Kenya about a bombing there and asked how could you have let this happen and she said I sent you a letter asking for more security for this very reason kid. We don’t hear how much noise there is when you talk about 9/11. 68k unresolved leads dating to 1995  . Man who warned about bombing made same claim before. CIA continuously warned White House before 9/11 that attack was eminent by already. Not limit of CIA but maybe intelligence. educated people told to enter phsytratic hospital under alias saying they hearing voices like empty, thought, and hollow. Everything else would be honest and tell them voices were gone. 19 day hospital day average one 60 days. Tons of pills taken and told to take notes, which became a pathology. Told one hospital that he would send sane patients, 193 patients and 41 said by one staff members as almost certainly sane. New problems created by correction. Now centralization new problem in intelligence after breaking down of barriers. FBI CIA competed to give different better accounts and keep them on their toes. FBI different from intelligence. Evidence for crimes vs probabilistic. FBI wants to string him up and CIA wants to string them along. Do they not work together because can’t/don’t want to or because benefit. Constant warning means not taken seriously. Perhaps insistence and politics want strong answer, occupation hazard people don’t want probabilistic.

Chapter 14 art of fail, why some choke and others panic

Choke as bad as quitting almost. How talented and elite fail. X button with a pattern. Can be told it’s a pattern and you learn explicitly. And you get better, but you’ll get better even if you aren’t told there is a pattern and don’t notice. When you train you start explicitly then eventually the implicit system takes over. Choking often makes explicit system take over like a beginner. Panic is different. Wipe short term memory and tunnel focus. Person with spare air supply panics when their primary fails and reach for partner air supply though that would just impair them both. Panic is thinking too little and revert to instinct and choke is thinking too much and go away from instinct. Airplane turning in air actually feels level to those in the cabin. Can be hard without horizon for pilot to notice dives. Panic makes sense it gets better with experience and convential failure. Choking is weird failure. Tell black and white it tests intellect and they do much worse then it’s just a research tool. White men do worse in high jumps with black teacher. This isn’t panic that can be solved by more experience and taking it seriously. Instead it’s second guessing, getting away from intuitions that help by taking it very seriously. Wimbledon, golf, there are often fumbles of championships.

Chapter 15 blowup, who can be blamed for challenger explosion - no one

After any accident, we have ritual where all the parts and events are fetishized and carefullly studied. Challenger went to crazy lengths to gather debris. 1986. Faulty seal in rocket booster and hit external fuel. 3 years later emerged with better plan with learning and ritual complete. Some scholars say this is really a facade. Challenger launch decision happened not because nasa didn’t do their job, but because they did exactly their job.

Normal functioning of complex systems. Human error? Or complex system as normal?  5 trivial combinations make major problems, called a normal accident. By normal, can be expected by complex systems. Minor failure will eventually become cateosphic with no one to blame. Challenger not really normal as o ring to stop leak was one big failure. Really symptom of nasa, o ring often seen as problematic. Not negliently when they pushed past warning for cold o rings as the word of anomaly was very common. Conformity. Risk homeostasis, things that make individual and company safer don’t because they take more risk if they can. Abs in one taxi cab didn’t change accident rate as they just drive faster. Consume risk reduction. Switching side of the road in Sweden actually reduced accident rate as people drive more carefully. 6 volumes of Oring level issues. We should accept high tech disasters will continue to happen.

Part 3

16 personality character and intelligence

2006 big break out 18 years after work. Genius usually associated with precocity and so youth. Creativity needs youth. It’s said Poets peak young, talent discovered and burns early. 11 top poems actually very random and no real evidence that poets peak early. Same with film. Picasso was prodigy at 20 and burned bright. Sexan did better later in his career. Prodigies rarely do open ended exploration and instead are conceptual and know where they want to go. Late bloomers have imprecise goals and search with perfectionism repeating and experimenting with an idea. Twain trial and error was to start hit problem and retry with new structure etc. two types of creatives. Late often thought to be just discovered or started late, but with this model they just aren’t good until later in their career. Late bloomer looks like a failure early, probably many never keep going. How could you learn how to be original, need time. Guy went to Haiti 20 times and after 18 years infield burst in scene with his books, his wife was basically his patron as he was a stay at home dad. Late bloomer really relies on others.

17 how do we hire when we can’t tell who is right for the job

800-1200 players a year to scout for NFL teams. But often some quaterbacks fail out. Scout watches college game and looks like one of the best quartbacks in the country but shakes his head when asked how that translates to the nfl. Quarterback problem, almost nothing you learn before they are hired will tell you how successful they will be on the job. Who to choose? Teaching metric , looks at how students change percentile from one year to another. Difference between god and poor is vast, poor teacher student will learn half a year of material and good teacher student will learn a year and a half of material. Teacher dwarfs school effects. Bad school with excellent teacher better than excellent school with bad teacher. Would have to cut class size in half to get boost from average teacher to one in the 85% percentile. And good and poor teachers cost the same. US could beat the world if they just replace 6-8% of teachers with teachers of average quality. But no one knows how to hire and discern these people. Football professional different than college, college runs spread where line spread out and so defense read early and bigger gaps as everyone slower. 1999 couch broke every record in college, but just in nfl. Iq test useless in prediction. Can’t be predicted really, no relation between position qb taken in test and performance in pros. Teacher important Regard for student perspective, child active but not out of control. Almost every student talks she responds, teacher sensitivity. Direct personal feedback to specific statement by student seems to be most important to academic success. High quality feedback has back and forth exchange to get deeper understanding. Yes no feedback provides almost no information. Ben was a star this problem, try and if you can’t we will all do it, check it with every student and talk fast. In 2 minutes, explained question and give many personalized feedback. Off the charts on feedback. Certification and graduate degrees no correlation to success. Desist event to stop misbehavior, tone and words make no difference in classroom orderly. Real ability is stopping chain of misbehavior before it started, use behavior to communicate to children she knows what they are doing. Eyes in the back of their head. Financial advice field, only college degree needed. Throw doors wide open no certification. 4 month training camp. Should be able to get 10 clients and 10 meetings a week and at least fast enough to play the game. 1000 interviews and 49 people invited, 23 hired as apprentice then 4 years should keep 4-6. He is not a discriminator really. Teachers says you should lower standards since they aren’t correlated to success and should be judged after starting job. 4 candidates to get one teacher. Pay grade super rigid. And need high reward at end of risky, so would balk at cost. Advisors spends 100-250k in first theee or four years. 2008 chase Daniels the praised QB free agent, not signed

Chapter 18 Dangerous minds criminal profiling made easy

Psycherist looked at messages of serial boomer and predicted he was orderly, unmarried, foreign, and would wear double breasted suit. All accurate. Instead of looking at wide pool of suspect, look at crime scene and narrow profile and predict who. Look at rape details and predict it’s an unmarried disheveled 17 year old. FBI has model of Two categories of serial killers, carefully planned and meticulous organized, or disorganized is blitz attacked and leaves way more evidence and doesn’t care about personality. Organized feels superior and articulate and disorganized is unattractive and too strange to date. Frequently like working for police and security guard cuz power. Usually same race as victims. But the disheveled loner without a gf is just a common profile, so need to profile more details out but often wrong details. Is organized vs disorganized actually good model? Someone actually categorized details on crime scenes expecting correlation between organized and disorganized details. But no seemed random. Can’t just look at one behavior in isolation. Is profile just general profiles that could apply to anyone? Rainbow rouse credit client with one trait and the other. You are quiet but can be life of the party. Older talk about forgotten dreams. Really general connection. You don’t work with child do you? No =>I thought so that’s not your role. Yes => I thought so. But psychiatrist from first section actually made a ton of predictions that were pretty wrong. Show same profile for multiple people and police think it is pretty accurate for all of them.

19- talent myth: are smart people overrated

McKinsey started war for talent and wanted to look at how great companies hired and promoted. Best companies were obsessed with talent and leadership ceaselessly hired and pushed and rewarded stars . Talent is new orthodoxy. Preached by consulting. Company that took it to heart was Enron. Enron was ultimate talent company bringing in the very best. Bring kids fresh out of Harvard and promoted without regard for seniority or anything. “We hire very smart people and pay them more than they think they are worth” Enron failed though, so is talent overrated. A need to challenged and rewarded, B encouraged, C told to shape up or ship out. 66% bigger bonus than next level and C got no bonus. How to rank? IQ, .2-.3 doesn’t pick up people. Test for this knowledge one example a, what to do when take over mediocre department with results expected quickly, good managers give frequent status reports and try to create ownership, and bad go for reorganization. Very little correlation between how peers and boss rates them. Only rigorous is specific detailed notes. Enron had huge movement in people pushing smart people. Not performance based but just “talent”. Argument for indulging employees. Someone wanted to let people trade them online and stars can work what they want. Stars flocked to this project because she wanted to work on it. Narcissist take much more credit and have such confidence that people believe them. Terrible managers yet self nominate in leadership gaps. So Enron. Malleable intelligence much more likely to take remedial over fixed intelligence. Praised for intelligence made people less likely to try and define themselves by it rejecting difficulty. Talent focus is on people not system.  Uboat in us Atlantic wasn’t centralized with super quick decisions like it needed to be, it was talent based but much worse than British system. Talent myth is people make organization good but other way around. Southwest looks at seniority not MBA with efficient organization. Walmart moved out the CEO that wasn’t inclusive. Mckinsey had open market and could snipe people in the company with no manager restraint. If everyone has to think outside the box, maybe it’s not a good box.

Chapter 20 - new boy network what do job interviews really tell us

What can you really know after sitting down with someone for an hour? Steve Ballmer got a question by a high school kid and just started recruiting him, with one interaction. Show questions about teacher effectiveness clips and 2 seconds is enough to judge personality.

And after one year of learning under them judge. The two results are super related, 2 seconds can equal a year. Good job interview training didnt cause a big improvement. Just handshake clip shown to people and interviewers in the interview were very well correlated. Don’t need to know someone without thinking you know them. Power of first impression. Perhaps too much, confirmation bias. Persons behavior at lunch predicts at lunch, but not in other areas. Personal grooming not related to how punctual you are. We habitually Underestimate context and overestimate consistency. Fundamental attribution error. Rephrase question to see priorities, instead of asking tell us about a time you were criticized. Say your boss is criticizing you in a meeting what do you do. Instead of deceive a time you multitask where it’s obvious what a good answer looks like. Ask, you have multiple competing deadlines how do you prioritize. Structured interview is only one who is good and predictive of job performance. Not general sense idea of someone. Instead more about chemistry and dating. Now much more like frat where people want to work with friends. Old boy network is friends, new boy network is who best shakes your hand.

21- what pit bulls can teach us about crime

Pit bulls breed for game and have low tolerance for pain. Bite hold and tear instead of growl. Pit bulls deembol dogs who show weakness by showing stomach reject these regular signs of weakness. Generalization is about what to focus on or ignore. When pit bulls attack should you ban dogs or aggressive dogs or pit bulls. Category problem. But pitbulls are resolute at being gentle and with anyone, pass many tests better than many other dogs in tests. Better categorized are stable rather than unstable generalization that is they don’t change over time. Pitbulls go up in attacks when they become more popular, what is the dog that people get if they want an aggressive dog. Aggressive dogs often reflect an aggressive socially isolated owner that attacks children or prey. Could better target these types of relationships and muzzle or nuture with previous non serious attacks but it’s easier to just ban the breed.
