title: 'Everything is Fucked'

The uncomfortable truth

Poleski volunteered to enter aushcitw for intelligence network. Poloski informed Allies about Holocaust and then escaped. Boy then infiltrated Soviet intelligence and could have escaped but died. "I have tried to live my life so in the hour of my death I would feel joy instead of fear"

Heroic means finding hope where everything seems fucked. Bring great why. We want more why. Little of what you say or do matters and we invent our purpose. And most of what we do is ignoring this. It doesn't matter if your startup works or the Lakers win, you care and pretend. Something needs to matter or you can't live. And altruism is always our minds goto to make life meaningful.

Our psyche needs hope. Opposite of happiness is hopelessness where things won't change. Everything is fucked. Hopelessness is root of misery and cause of misery. Depression is crisis of a failed or meaningless future. Construction of hope is minds primary process. We turn mistakes and tragedies into hope like death of family member. Hope narratives are stabilizing force and provide sense of purpose. If you have to find life purpose, you don't know what's important.

Religious people rally behind unknowable purpose and faith. We have to start at nilism and build up to a lasting hope. Nilism says success for sake of success and pleasure for pleasure. No grander purpose

Paradox of progress

Now is better than ever before. Internet, poverty, war, education, life, wealth, healthy. Yet, depression on 80 year up swing. Lower life satisfaction and drug overdose. Nearly half of all Americans report feeling isolated or alone in their lives. Less social trust. In 1980s, people asked who they discuss important personal matters mode was 3, 2006 mode was 0. Safety highest, yet more hopeless. The wealthier and safer the place you live, the more likely you are to commit suicide. Hope doesn't care about stats just problem. The better the world, the more to lose and less to hope for. 3 things for hope: sense of control, belief in value of something, and community.

Self control is an illusion

To have a fight, two people have to care. Elliot got brain tumor and lost something. Didn't care for wife and missed meetings. Doctors said he was fine. But he couldn't explain why he did things, but could say what. Lost everything, but didn't care and no remorse or embarrassment. Showed him death and despair and he didn't care. No value judgements. Why couldn't he reason that it was important to do work or something. Lobotomy made people with extreme anxiety or something would make them chill by killing frontal lobe. Elliot's. We tend to think reason saves us from emotion. If you fail, they have weakness of self control. Applaude determination and startup CEOs tireless. Desire to change yourself. We want to believe ability to do something is just deciding to do it, we can control our future. Lobotomy and Elliot failed though. Emotions are instrumental.

Two brains

Impulse and intuition. Fast and Isobel and overreacts

Vs

reason. Slow.

So we try to control emotions. Feeling besides leads. Moved to action by emotion. Self control is problem of emotion. Can't be reasoned with only emotional solutions. Thinking brain navigator and influence it. Feeling brain of pretty stubborn despite infinite facts. Thinking brain likes to justify what happened. Self serving bias and makes it awful. What feels right is right. Outright delusion perhaps. Clown car when feelings lead the way towards fun or power or hate. No real identity . Feel good means is good.

The avoidance of this leads to this self denial thing. Before we were exact, Now we worry about existential shit. Went from avoiding feeling to some going so hard back in it's the same clown car of new age spirituality. Self control idea is overblown by thinking brain pretending to have control.

Thinking brain

Empathize with impulses and shit. All how it's feeling reasonably. Recall with feelings. Make concession to your feeling brain and never ignore it. Practice to feel emotion. Self-control is pretend and when your brain are aligned. Thinking brain creates the map though. Newton noted we are all liars. Not from malice, but from lying to themselves.

Three laws of emotion:

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We naturally try to close imoral gaps. If someone hurt you, they can make up for it. If someone is super nice to you, you equalize it. When you change your value hierarchy there is no loss. When you decide to work hard instead of party there is no loss because you don't miss what you give up. Law 2: Self worht is sum of emotions over time. If we can't eequalize, we feel powerless. If a moral gap persists, we come to expect it and decide we deserve it. Even if we decide/see we are studs or sex is fine, our feleings about it because of that childhood are pretty set. Both thinking you are particularly bad or good are narcissistic and you tend to rubber band between the two. We all have some to some degree and need some Fundamental attribution error.

Law 3: you identity stays your identity until a new experience happens against it

After broken heart, either u are shit or all boss are shit. Change of mind is too hard for feeling brain. Narratives are key to our values and look for people with similar narratives. Whether good or bad thing happens and they didn't or did desrve it. Every narrative is a daisychain of thses two elements. Collection of narratives is identity. Longer held stronger. Childhood trauma fucks us up because of this domino effect. Ideas feel natural and we'll real. This why no gro wth without discomfort. We can do future projection and visualization that eventually our feeling brain accepts. What if wuestion is thinking brain nudging feeling brain. Tell stories. Create imaginary enemy you have to out compete and wake up in the morning to beat. We create communities naturally with people of the same values. Differences are small, but emotionally so we feel different.

Chapter 4 how to make all your dreams come true

How to start your own religion.  Religion provides hope, community. Tear down the system, it's the systems fault. Start with the poor and marginalized. Faith is essential and prediction/expectation of future. God value is how you see the world and where you drive hope. It can be yourself, others, relationships. Facts don't have effect on thinking brain. We determine effect by values. Science as good value is pretty great but I'll get to that later.

Spiritual religions

Certain actions in this life, will pay if in the next life. Promised hope in after life because the normal life was so fucked and sad. Hope through death

Ideological religions

Certain actions will produce great benefits in this life if enough people do it. Veganism, libertanism, democracy etc. Money works becomes people believe in it yet not verifiably valuable. Political power is completely interpersonal and sports all demonize and herofiy some. Rituals are visual and experiencal respresentation of what we value. Emotion is action so reinforces feeling brain. Prayer is gratitude journal.

Step 5 promise heaven give them hell. Promise heaven and the more they fail the more they will blame themselves. Brace we are all fucked no easy solution. feaders need followers that are dissatisfied.

Part 6 profit for profit

Religions compete for resources. God value slowly shifts to preserving it. More you have, more you have to lose. The only thing that can ever truly destroy a dream, is having it come true.

Chapter 5 hope is fucked

God is dead. Nietzche. Genius, but was everything he claimed to loath: weak, cared for by others. He had many genius professor feminist women caring for him. He filled them with hope. Whenever you drop people together, some will have natural advantages and accumulate more resources and rich get richer. After gens, strstification. Masters and slaves. Masters craft value narratives that they deserved it. Master morality, might makes right. Slave morality believes poorest and most unfortunate deserves the best. Equality, desrve more because of suffering. Slave morality closes moral gap out feeling brain feel. Christianity of charity and pity pages already morality.

Science is maybe the only good thing humans have made ever. Science unlike older religions can change. People's lives could change in their lifetime and they could see life getting bettet. Lack infallibility which means tragedy can make you question. Nietzche noticed we are not equipped to explain our cosmic signicance. Nationalism, communism, capitalism all suck. They will conflict and produce violent where the good they are for are ourselves. Greek gods started with men who just parties all the time. Then bored, they created women and gave her Pandora's box which released evil and something to fight for.

Hope can both uplift and destroy is. Hitler hoped. Need hope fundamentally: 1) have something to look forward to 2) believe ourselves in control enough to achieve it 3) have a community to achieve it with. Emotions generate actions and create narratives of meaning and create communities of religions. Conflicts maintains meaning and purpose. Hope requires everything being fucked and anti something, but we need it.  So we are stuck between nilism or perpetual conflict. After a few centuries, niezchte beleived all narstive sand we I'll have a real existential crisis. We look beyond good and evil. Start with love of one's fate. Unconditional acceptance of all life and experience. Desire reality. Not hope for better just be better. Reality liberates us from responsibility. No reason not to respect ourselves and not live life as if it would repeat. Man is a rope between beast and superhuman out above an abyss and we are an overture to something greater. She Live for others even though she couldn't live for herself. I love those who don't know how to love for they are the ones who cross over.

Part 2 everything's fucked

Chapter 6 formula of humanity

Kant would wake up wit for 3 hours and lecture for 4 hours and walk have dinner etc everyday for 40 years. Intelligent powerhouse. Individual rights and global governing boyd and moral philosophy. Early child explore because we build up our preferences and value hierarchy so we can know what to hope for. Maturity is developing higher level values like cooperation and playing by societal rules, think steps ahead. Young kids are tryants without empathy. Transactional first. But many things can't be transactional like love and respect. Happiness is not a game you win if you follow the rules. Adulthood is developing ability to do what is right because it is right. Honesty is end. Untaught child that is selfish will get wrecked in real life no one wants to be friends. Need stability and trustworthy institutions to develop principles. Coddled and neglected often similar outcomes. Hyper transactional approach to the world sucks. Leap of faith to endure Pain and abandon hope for better life because it is right. Sacrifice is not a translation, but you do it ANYWAY. Can't barter for happiness. What you are willing to bargain with you are willing to bargain away like human life or happiness if you value something else more.

Kant, we are special to with reason. Direct reality. Supreme value is the ability to decide value. Propagate and grow consciousness. Person as end not means and basis of morals. Hope is transactional. Notice this is not. Improve the world by improving our selves. Creating a good person and life are the end. This affects others and ripples out and can change the world.

The modern maturity crisis

Democracy based on idea that it prevents a single group of people to fuck everyone else. Transactional leaders and values defined in laws and rights. Left wants no pain, right wants Authoritain government to limit freedom so they have freedom. Extremists are immature

Chp 7 pain is universal constant

Preface induced concept change, blue for effect. Blue dots and purple dots. With many blue dots in beginning, they changed to more shades of purple and people expected blue dots and misnamed it. Ethical and unethical proposals, start with mixed and then lower amount of unethical so readers move the goal posts and take ethical to be unethical.

Trauma and violence have been moved to mean like words. Core of paradox of progress. Emotional responded aren't based on size of problem but amount of adversity we expect.

Physics based on time and space. Time and space are universal constants. Einstein said nope, it's all relative. Lengthy and time are depends on observe, speed of light is constant. Universal constant if experience is not constant. Most of our reality is realize to our perception. Ask a ton of people to rate their experience, and usually people are a 7. Short shoot ips and diens at high and lows. Things are pretty much always fine and if only we were just a little happier. We are not unchanging. Our expectations and perceptions warp to our pain. Hedonic treadmill. Blue dots effect. That is why happiness as a value is such a waste. We invented technology to improve things but what should we improve. So let's remove pain they said, but it can't be done. Only increases sensitivity to suffering. Everything unpleasant is what presents itself. Pain is experience. Pursuit of happiness is toxic, if we are going suffer we might as well do it well.

Democratic leader in south Vietnam was against buddism. Monk in Vietnam let himself on fire and didn't move from meditation. The picture generated emotion and primal response in everyone, purity and resolve.

Fragile case break. Robust resists change. Anti fragility, some systems get better in adversity. Startups and drug dealers and some relationships are anti fragile. Body gets better with exercise. Mind can be either. Disaster has our mind scramble for learning. Lowered stress makes us more fragile.

Rigorous meditation is observing yourself and the pain and not being sucked away. With enough focus, we can survive any pain. Pain is inevitable but suffering is a choice.

Could remove death which removed sacrity because infinite time and attention so can always do it later. No loss. Humility, bravery, virtues are antufragile. Quality of lives is really to quality of character which is our relationship to pain. We can choose pain to bring in and don't look away and engage it. Pain is source of value and purpose

Chp8 Feelings economy

Marketing used to be for communicating facts. But new marketers in 1920s thought just his how impulsive we are. Torches of freedom for women and political movement. Equal opportunity long cancer. He started fake news, celebrity endorsements, and was feuds nephew. Freud argued we are animals. Shame and insecurity. Finds moral gaps. World runs on feelings. Money always once currency for bytable values. Create value with innovation replace pain with a better one, two avoid pain. Increases happiness.  Entertainment. Can lose control. As we get richer it's harder, innovation becomes diversions, avoiding pain. Instead of flying cards, we got 140 characters. Opens rich society to mental health problems. Convenience. Marketing to satiate our pursuit of happiness. Comforting that we all had the same shows and culture, social cohension. 2000 technologists saw way to make the world unified, intelligent and prosperous. World doesn't run on information, it runs on feelings. Internet users don't go for truth, goes for what is feeling right not what is true. Gives what we want not what we need which this book says is bad.

Business says they just giving people what they want. Faster internet, faster cars, etc. If we close FB, something else would take it's place. Giving what we want is Low ethical bar. 1. We want awful shit 2. We are manipulated 3. Diversion makes us fragile. 4. Privacy

that one marketers thought government could control and appese. Thought Freedom for most is impossible. People need hierarchy and authority. Marketing giving people feeling of freedom. #fake freedom of diversions . Diversions narrow our conceptual world and give us compulsive low level behaviors. Paradox of choice. If you feel only free when you comfort, you are a slave your feelings. 20 vs 2 cereals is not more freedom it's more variety. It's the same meaningless shit. More stuff makes us more likely to year others as means.

Real freedom

Self limitation. Freedom to give things up. Pleasure comes and go, but you can always choose your sacrifice. Freedom is commitments to guitar and a partner. Life hacking it's challenge to learn language and travel to 10. Empty calls calories without necessary commitment. Marathon as goal is just trying to have appearance of running. Fake freedom is seeing world as transactional. Freedom requires nothing of world. Putnam bowling alone documents collapse of community in 2000. Bowling is more popular, but bowling league collapsing. Social trust declined and loniliess. We are replacing a few high quality relationships with many less quality one's. We need to be able to cost or pleasures, but to we are so close we can't make real choices.

Plato says you grow through self denial not indulgence. He hated democracy. We know people instinctly about pain and seek happiness, but we are never satisfied. When institutions don't make people happy, we blame the instuition and we become more childish and self centered. We stop wanting to endure Pain or negotiate. We want a strong leader to make everything good, q tryant. Democracy requires strong citizens. Freedom demands discomfort because each will have to face ideas different than it own. Democracy sucks, but what's better. Let's other religions live within it.

Chapter 9 the final religion

Chess player must make value decisions about what is worth computing. Stockfish was best software for 4 years, until alpha zero designed for all games ever and beat stockfish after a day of training winning or tieing every game. Ai will become so advanced it will give us medicine, change society, and policies without us being able to comprehend why.peopke will start to praise the algorithms and hope doing this certain thing will make it happy and curry favor. And we have a new religion and worship it. I for one welcome our ai overloads. Algorithms already run much of our lives, size of products, route to work, etc make our lives easier.

Life is stuff that replicates itself. Biological arms race to start around. Survival of best information process in? Sensing ears, long distance yes, smell of blood. But we can plan and strategize and problem solve. Domination. We made up algorithms of values and knowledge and now they suck in this new environment. All problems are us. Thinking brain often overridden and slower and feeling brain sucks now.

Three eminent threats to humanity said by elon: nuclear warfare, climate change, and "I hope the computers decide to be nice". Human sucks at morality, ai will understand it better. What if this whole individual identity is limiting and ai decided we should be collective? Nietsche said man transition bring good and evil. Ai is the something greater. We need to adapt technology to mend or broken psychology. Treat people as means not ends at scale. Instead of hope instead of despairing or even know, just be better. Be more compassionate, resikent. Maybe one day we can become more than human.

I Dare to hope for a world beyond hope.ability to reason and act highest form. Marry thinking and feeling. Aware of our pitfalls of desire and seek discomfort that causes growth. Opt in to self limitation. Depend something better for yourself before the world. Evidence is real. Ai will help us see ourselves and understand stats. Education better with emotional development. VR will become reality and way to create meaning and hope. We will get some hectic s to give some meanings and artificial crisies. Hope will be harvested. Maybe one day we can find meaning without conflict. All along we're we nothing.
