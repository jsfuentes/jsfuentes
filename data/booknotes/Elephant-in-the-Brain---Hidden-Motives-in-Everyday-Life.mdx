title: 'Elephant in the Brain - Hidden Motives in Everyday Life'
---

#Book by [[Robin Hanson]] and [[Kevin Simler]]
- Intro
    - Thesis: we are strategically blind to key aspects of our motives 
    - Elephant in the room an important issue people are reluctant to acknowledge or address. Elephant in the brain an important unacknowledged feature of how our minds work and introspective taboo. 
    - Why people spend so much on medical care? To be healthier? But people are pretty happy with the appearance of good healthcare over the air, sleep, stress, exercise policies that people are pretty uninterested in. 8% of patients wouldn't pay $50 to know death rates of dangerous heart care. Mom kisses the child's injury and everyone enjoys it to show their social support. [[Healthcare]] does heal us but is an elaborate kiss the boo-boo. An exercise in conspicuous caring. 
    - Elephant sized with impactful impact on metrics. 
    - Software startup had social grooming with all hands and social status. Dress up social status in eupheism like experience or seniority, instincts act this way even without acknowledging it. 
    - We are designed to act in our self interest while trying hard not to appear selfish. In order to throw them off the trial, we do selfdeception. Elephant can be seen if we look. Elephant is selfishness. 
    - Human behavior is rarely what is seems. We would blush at our grandest deeds if we knew all of why we did it. Robert Wright have written that human brain designed to deceive itself from evolutionary psychology. When people buy luxury goods people say it’s the comfort, but really about the social status. Schools, charities, hospitals serve covert agenda alongside their official ones. 
    - This book will paint portrait of human species and society strategically self deceived. We constantly playing politics while keeping our mind pure.
        - 1) microsociology, we involuntary laughter and flash facial expressions at right time
        - 2) cognitive biases intentionally go for pro social motives for goal to appear better than one really is 
        - 3) primates and humans are similar with sexual displays, politically maneuvering but humans don’t have as much as you would expect doesn’t add up 
        - 4) economic puzzles, institutions often behave as if they were designed to achieve other goals. 
            - Schools to learn but actively interfere more about credentialing and ranking. 
            - We act on our hidden motives in groups as well as individuals. 
            - Buyers and sellers both pretend to be exchanging one thing but really exchanging another lien the art scene more about sex than art. 
            - Trillions of dollars are shoveled into our institutions for social competition, not pessimistic great news that we can do much better if we correctly diagnose. 
    - Thesis 
        - 1) people judging us all the time and our motives 
        - 2) we are eager to look good and up play our good motives 
        - 3) applies to our thoughts, a reversal of what to say 
        - 4) in some areas, politics, we are quick to point out bad motives but in pretty medicine everyone has pretty motives and we can all be wrong together. Very real sense that not knowing would be better undermining the very concealing mechanics we were designed to avoid.
- Part 1 Stare at Elephant
- Part 2 Look at society and institutions
- Part 1 Stare at Elephant - why we hide our motives
    - Chp 1 animal behaviors
        - Social grooming
            - What? Need to keep fur clean in groups. Ape goes hunched over and other ape purposefully removes bits of stray matter. 
            - Why? Could be straightforward for hygiene. Most primates spend far too long grooming than necessary.a type of Baboons spend’s 17% while some primates spend 1/10 of a percent of their time. Body size doesn’t relate to amount of grooming. Dunbar says it’s about politics forging alliances saying I will help you and I will let you be behind me and close to my face. Grooming creates trust. Higher rank receive more grooming and partners more likely to help each other. Note there is some role of hygiene and they can like doing it for its sake.
        - Competitive altruism. 
            - Arabian Babblers are small brown bird that live in small groups. Hierarchy among males with fighting with alpha winning often and some violent among the same rank which can lead to one dying or exile. Some babblers attack or guard seemingly altruistic. Alpha not only give food but shove it down throats or unwilling birds, and bully others off guard perch. Could say it’s for stronger to take on more of the burden of care. But alpha only bully’s betas not gammas and beta and gamma only those equal or below them. Form some sort of credit to mate and less likely to be attacked. 
            - knowledge suppression only needed when others have partial visibility to your mind and judge you based on it.
    - Chapter 2 competition
        - Humans have intelligence, helpless babies, and so flexible. Archeology mostly about things that persist so tools over social patterns. 
        - Why did brain grow so big? 
            - Cooperation against nature. Or zero sum social competition. People like to focus on cooperation here. Why do trees grow so tall? Why not grow horizontal? Redwood is in evolutionary arms race in dense forest to be tall enough for sunlight or they will die. As are humans evolved in the dense forest competitions against ourselves. Early sapiens lived in groups of 20-50 playing primate games.
            - Speed of growth imply a some sort of social pressure. Arms race between lying and lying detection. Let’s reverse bias and focus on these competition motives. 
            - The 3 games: sex, social status, and politics. Each game share two skills: ability to assess and attract partners. Sex => mates, politics => allies, status => friends loyal skills.
                - Sex game is about gaining sexual attractiveness to get mates.
                    - Mating not survival is the name of the game. Even if you died a violent death, if you have child first you won. When animals pair bonded and monogamous incentives for males and females converge. Humans aren’t exactly this, but we will approximate it. Fixed number of mates so zero sum. Women and men must choose each other. Jeffer Miller says art and humor are elaborate mating displays. 
                - Social status is about gaining rank or position in a group to get friends. 
                    - The more others will defer to you. Two flavors: dominance and prestige. 
                        - Dominance is from intimating others. Dominance is about competition and strength and power.
                        - Prestige is from being an impressive human specimens. Prestige is about respect that must be freely conferred. Popularity contest not just by being rich beautiful and good at sports but also by being funny, kind, and intelligent. Prestige is your price on the market for friendship and association. 
                    - Sexual attractiveness is your price on the mating market. 
                    - Everyone strives to make themselves more attractive by learn skills and charms. Positive side effects like science and art, but status is zero sum. 
                - Politics is about gaining status to get allies.
                    - Machiavellian, also among chimpanzees. Dominance hierarchy, politics means coalitions vs individual competition.
                        - Males need strong males and allies. We have the most complex coalitions and interest groups, companies, friends, gangs. 
                        - Two ways Machiavellian vs castling through free charm. Even the nicer way is the same drive. Many intermediate goals and play into each other.
                - We need to advertise our own traits. Signal is anything used to convey info. 
                    - This creates an arms race like trees to stand out and be evaluated as good. 
                    - Honest signals reliably correspond to something about the sender. Compared to dishonest. 
                        - A lions growl is impossible for mouse to make. Bright colors for poisonous animals.
                        - The best signals(honest) are expensive and even more expensive to fake. 
                        - Loyalty can be expensive. Our strange behaviors like art can be because of its value as signals. 
                    - Counter signaling! 
                        - Casual friends distinguish themselves from enemies by being friendly. Great friends can distinguish themselves from causal by being unfriendly . 
                        - No signal vs counter signals, insiders usually know how to interpret. 
                - Zerosum Competition is wasteful, we can turn competition into cooperatioon through noorms and norm enforcement
                    -  It would be better for redwoods if they capped height, so wasteful. 
                    - Foragers 20-50 gather food with some fishing/hunting, leaving community is basically death sentence. Most man, women, and child do same thing. Not much to gain from property or trading. Decision made by consensus and women sometimes move bands when coming of age. Patrilocal. Not really mate for life but long term monogamy. Pretty egalitarian and hierarchy is fairly alien. Counsel of elders maybe but group vilginant for anyone to bullying or dominant. Cultural norms are adaptable. 
                    - Norms mean not just worrying about immediate action but retribution from third parties. Collective enforcements allows this forager egalitarianism. 
                    - Reverse dominance hierarchy. Weapons level playing field and first hit can maim or kill unlike apes. Political skill takes over as important. First norm against being a too dominant alpha. Modern norms can be pretty difficult to enforce. 
                    - Gossip and reputation enforce norms. Gossip is a feature of every society ever and curtails bad behavior of even the strong. Create consensus through gossip. 
                    - Reputational damage can be much better than other damage and rewards those who enforce norm. Doesn’t seem worth it to enforce norms cuz you could be hurt for stopping someone from cutting. Doesn’t make sense unless there is a norm for punishing those who don’t enforce norms or reward. 
                    - us unlawful to witness crime and not report it. Norms more precisely regulated intentions like cheating. Bragging or showing off has good incentive, but norm against. Discreet. 
                    - Currying favor of people of high status increases your own status. Illegitimate if lie or cheat because ruins a good signal. Catch all is selfish motives. Why doctor? Prestigious and great pay. Why did you break up? I can do better. Instead pro social. 
                    - If norms restrict competitor, then there would no reason to be big brain political. So successful norms should have shrinked brain, instead they balloned cuz cheating.
    - Chapter 4 cheating
        - Everyone cheats. 
            - Most follow big important rules like rape, murder, robbery. But we do drugs, lie, etc. 
            - Cheating lets us reap benefits without costs. 
            - 100% of Olympic swimmers pee in pool. 
            - We have special hardware just to detect cheating, when logic puzzles framed as cheating scenarios we get much better. Best way is to shoot being seen, so are actuely aware of eyes. 
            - Shame is emotion to avoid breaking norms in public. 
            - Drinking in public, police usually won’t bother. We can get away with the tiniest of pretense. Emperor has no clothes, common knowledge is not just something everyone knows but something everyone knows everyone knows. Bcc vs cc emails. Open and closed lesbian. How widely and how commonly it’s know is two dimensions of secret not just how widely it’s known? Scalpers(sell tickets) shout to buy tickets, as it’s illegal to sell them in many states. Difference between someone knowing your lying and being able to convince others. Pretense, discretion communication, subtlety. Prevent norm violation from becoming common knowledge. Pretense don’t actually have to convince anyone higher make them think others could be convinced. Can pretend to believe it for your own personal benefit. Indirect, innuendo gives slight semantics ambiguity. Loss formal and slang is more direct and of the record. Like asking someone for sex vs to come back to your place. Miscommunication is the price for skirting the norm in front of the future audience that could hear about the date. Shared cultural norms are ambiguous cuz shared giving room for violation. So big brain is to avoid and punish norms.
- 5 selfdeception
- Deception happens throughout nature. Part dead, look like flower or eyes. Rap benefit without paying cost. Our mind often subconsciously act in bad faith. Have suite of ego defense mechanics. Sports often have people decide they are less tired or injuries then they are. Sports players with higher self deception tend to perform better. Patients with bad test results more likely to misremember their results. 2 schools of thoughts: 1) old school Freud self defense unconscious pain to protect ego. To reduce anxiety and protect our self esteem. Harold Savin “Depressed people see all the pain in the world, how horrible people are with each other and they tell you everything about themselves, what their weaknesses, what terrible things they’ve done to other people. And the problem is they’re right, and so maybe  the way we help people is to help them be wrong” But why would nature do this, it could instead make anxiety mechanic weaker. 2) new school, self deception as manipulation. Ultimately self serving. Schelling. Mixed motive games where players have most of their wants overlap. Cooperation is good and necessary. To play chicken, remove your steering wheel. Option limiting is strategic like email over chat. Right to be sued is also right to enter contract. Might prefer not to know robbers face because he’s less likely to kill you. Sabotaging yourself can be the winning move, value lies in convincing others. Self deception at this level only useful when you are playing against people with access to your mental state. Advertising distorted thinking is winning moves, not self deceiving means putting yourself at a disadvantage. Lying is difficult and you fear getting caught. So Socially useful beliefs are first class citizens next to world modeling stuff, “wear a mask long enough and it becomes your face”. 4 ways: madman, loyalist, cheerleader, and cheater. 1) Madman “I’m doing this no matter what, get out of my way”. Commuting ourselves to course of action change incentives for other players. Athletes suffer when not a madman. 2) loyalist “sure I’ll believe you” earn most trust. Loyalty really about believing something irrationally. Not loyal to be good friend to good friend, but when facts would seem they are bad. Likewise believing truth doesn’t make you loyal. 3) cheerleader “I know this is true, come on believe it with me”. Political or founder that will win no matter what can get supporters. 4) cheater “I don’t know what your talking about, my motives were pure”. Cost is sub optimal decision making. Luckily often part of our brain knows the truth and so our saving grace is inconsistentcy. We are more like a committee. Modules with inconsistent models of world and can be subdivided or connected in many different ways like people(Republican, age, sex, etc). Don’t always agree. Our conscious system can not know something we make decisions on our our conscious system can’t override some emotions. Self discretion is perhaps most important mind game, giving less mental prominence to damaging info. Our own motives are best thing to be deceived about
- 6 counterfeit reason.
- Jp Morgan “People have two reasons to do something, a good reason and the real reason”. We often rewarded for acting selfishly and less so for acknowledging them and our brain responds to these incentives. We don’t always know the whys but we sure pretend to. split brain patients have their left brain question for the right brain actions and the left Brian gives a reason. People normally can’t question our motives as easily as something about the world that can be fact checked. Disability denial, they will rationalize reasons they don’t want to move their arm even when they can’t. Why are you a Christian demands a reason and we supply. Studied of this says all brains have an interprter a press secretary. No matter what must defend and explain, usually good because connection to both sides of the brain. Can’t generalize from split brain because brains complex. Press sectarian can use strategic ignorance and can serve as buffer that defends against potentially revealing the real motives. Companies have same incentives as brains finding or firms and press secrets useful. Very real sense that we that identify are the press secretary, our job is to defend it. We are not the king, we are the creepy guy next to the king. We think we are good at introspection, but an illusion. Strangers to ourselves, adaptive unconscious that creates many of our judgements and actions. We must infer these causes. No more a accurate than a stranger in the same culture. Misdirection is great for distracting press secretary to explore its rationalization. Laundry detergent with the same detergent and different boxes. People thought detergent were different even if they just like the box. Men asked to choose women they thought was more attractive. After choosing researcher used slight of hand to give them the other women and then asked them to explain their choice. Not only did majority not notice, many came up with reasons. Other approach is split two large groups, vary parameter and see how judgments change. Teacher identica, but difference how he treated students nice vs rude. They rated professionalism and everything worse if rude. Child will continuously go to the bathroom to not go to sleep, then wet themselves if they are denied just to prove their serious. Adults are the expert version of this. We cherry pick our pro social reason with half truths. We can’t be certain reasons is counterfeit. We seek to demonstrate these alternate motives and expect most listeners to buy 70% of what we are selling.
- Part 2: Hidden Motives In Everyday life
- Chp 7 body language
- Body language very important, but not twught like speech. Coordinate some of our most meaningful activities from love, friendship, social status. Tone, facial, etc. More savvy children at reading facial expression, more popular at school. We feel body language should be involuntary, can be creepy otherwise. We largely unaware, we strategically blind for our selfish motives. Signal is something sender sends to change behavior of receiver in benefit of both sender and receiver . Cue is like a tell that only benefits the receiver. Honest signals. Words is arbitrary like hola or hello, but body language is actually related to reality. No culture has looking away be associated with love. Honest signals differential expensive. Mating calls can also attract predators so expensive. Guarantee honesty for koala mating calls. Open posture makes person vulnerable, honest signal of comfort. Hug is bad if you don’t trust.
- Ancestors had sex for centuries before learning to speak. Men and women norm modesty to not flaunt sexuality. So we negotiate nonverbal. Carefully negotiated escalation of intimacy. Eye behavior is hard to notice so great for discreet signals. Mirror posture and touch. Dance escalates intimacy seeing if their brain can sync. Coy and jealously. Hand holding and closeness often for signals to third party mate guarding. One researcher team found man did more of this when person made more romantic threat like male or personal questions. Women preferred smell of more complementary immune system. Men prefer smell of gay men. Largely unconscious.
- Politics. Closest grooming is hair care or back massage. Comfortable we touch them so display friendship. Hunch and plant feet when guarded. Camp David more casual saying I am comfortable with you. Hand shake equal and hand kiss is submissive gesture. Gossip(judging behavior of others). The ones we seen most unaware of is social status. Even though we care and flaunt it so much. High status less likely to be attacked and have more to come for defensive and louder. Loudness is strong signal and boom box or extra bright clothes. Lower status follows higher status lead. Awkward negotiation if doesn’t work out. Larry king showed king adjusted his speech for higher status and his guest to him for lower status. Similar analysis looked at debate tone of voice accommodation to predict election results. We attracted to prestige. In Dominance game Eye contact is act of aggression. Submissive look away first and steal glances. In prestige, looking is giving someone attention. Can be difficult to navigate prestige and dominance. CEO in meeting gets attention when giving speech but afterwards in conversation resort to dominance eye contact. Visual dominance ratio is fraction of time you spend looking into other persons eyes when you talk over when you listen. Less eye contact when speaking less ratio under 1.0 and shows submissive. We consistently do this. 0.92 college freshman talking to high school senior but 0.59 for college student to prestigious medical school. Even changes for the subject, quite natural. Body language is ambiguous and can be feature rather than bug allowing smile saying your hot without breaking norms and unquotable. We know smile is happy, but we fumble if we talk about sex body language or status. And it’s uncomfortable because we have something to hide.
- 8 laughter
- Laughing is contorting face and pretty weird. We laugh even if child is blind and deaf out of the womb. Same across all cultures and involuntary social behavior. Prior to 1940: superiority theory from Socrates, Hobbes says ts fundamentally mean spirited against someone, relief theory from Freud from nervous energy that is unused so tension plus relief, incongruity theory Kant when our expectations are voliated. Our conscious mind doesn’t control it. Biology of laughter. Why do we laugh at tickles and make noises? 1990 studies noticed we laugh 30x in social situations than alone. Optimized for social situations and canned laughter tricks us into thinking its a social situation so we more likely to laugh. Speakers laugh 50% more than listeners. Infants laugh more when tickled by their mother. Not a knee jerk reaction then but regulates social interaction. Apes and chimps also laugh in many of the same situations. Laughter is a play signal. Laugh and then make a terrible face at a baby. If you just make a terrible face, the baby more likely to scream. Play is mode of being to explore and practice skills. How do monkey Telegraph they are just play fighting? We are just playing so essential many animals have signals just for it. Dogs have play bow and Chimps use open mouth play face, or engage in exaggerated slow movement. Humans have awk, play scream, laugh, smile. Laugh at our own actions to say just kidding. Laugh to others is about perception l, I know your only kidding. We only laugh when something unpleasant to confront, which without laughter would be too serious. Is grandma laughs after falling you can laugh too, but if you laugh first how can you be comfortable if you don’t know she is you insensitive child. Humor seems like it causes laughter, but taking broader perspective propensity to laugh provides goal for humor to achieve. Humor is art form to create laughter with right perception. Play mode, multiple people, dial to serious close then back to play. Why we so ignorant about laughter? Just play right. Laughter is powerful probe into relationships. Norms and psychology distance. Toddler and child are mostly physical laugh and when we get older more about norms. Need to probe boundaries so many social and sexual norms. Faint across boundary or cross the boundary and enjoy if it’s safe. What we laugh at shows what norms we don’t take seriously. When we laugh together brings us together, but not when at someone’s sacred cow. Psychological distance, what we laugh at leaks how much we care about others. “Tragedy is when I cut my finger, comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die“ When someone else falls and hurts and you laugh, it can be seen as agrresive but from the same place. Laughter is feeling safe, and something might be wrong but I don’t care. Prison rape haha. Teasing and need more warmth than small pain. We rarely make conscious calculations and because involuntary so good for watching norms. Laughter or wink is necessarily deniable, yet honest. And we can deny convincingly because we don’t understand. Humor can greatly show gray areas of context and situation, language too precise. Beauty it gets to be just joking and honest. “If you wanna tell people the truth make them laugh, otherwise they will kill you” m
- Chapter 11 conversation
- 20% of waking life in conversation. Sharing information is arguably the primary function of language. Language evolved before science and books emerged, so how did it help the animal lives were once lived. Conversion is a transaction. Listener is low cost and benefit by learning. Speaking seems to cost nothing, but missed opportunity cost of only knowing things and cost of learning it. Humans happy to share, so what’s the benefit. Speakers benefit by recripocity. Puzzle 1, people don’t keep track of conversation favors or resent people who don’t contribute. Puzzle 2: people are very eager to speak when listening would be better under this theory. Puzzle 3: ears pretty small compared to our complex mouths. Human speakers tightly constrained by topic of relevance, speakers who change topic to much looked down on. Don’t immediately exchange with strangers.  Resolution: sex and politics not exchange of information. Speakers trying to impress their audience. Raise their social value, mates and allies. From this perspective not really about how many tools they give you, it’s the size and breadth of their tool kit because once you are allied you have all of that at your disposable. So you judge how big their toolkit is based on how freely and able they are to pull out new and useful tools. More about speakers showing they have unique large backpacks, knowledge secondary. Text is here info, subtext is I’m the type of person who knows things. Leaders have high linguistic skills. Why people struggle to speak because spoils are from speaking. There is no debt and speaking is a reward itself. Why relevant? Anyone Can rattle off memorized facts, but relevant facts unplanned indicates general knowledge. Prestige is ones value as an ally. Prestige can be by showing other impressive people have chosen you as an ally. People love news, Athenian and British across centuries were characterized as obsession with news. Practical info, if anything we are more obsessed now when google makes all info a click away. People care little about the most relevant policy information for voting. We continue to ignore betting market and pundit accuracy. 2 weeks is relevant and so our talk is more relevant and intelligent and about prestigious people so we can increase our pedigree by association. Academic conversation about prestige sssociates, institutions, and compete to give talks not to listen. College students would pay more to prestige students even when they never interact or read the research. Reliability of research goes down as more popular, but that’s less relevant(prestigious). Donors can earn prestige by association with artists. Prizes of science don’t allow this association like grants do. Referees of journals more about if author seems impressive and difficult methods and not about benefit. Authors want to impress you.
- Consumption
- We work as hard as we do 100 years ag. Conspicuous consumption is for the rare race of sex and status. 2 vs 3 tiers above you didn’t make sense. To someone struggle in Africa, your lifestyles is equally as flashy as a Saudi prince. Do you really need to spend enough to feed a family of 4 at Olive Garden for a team of chefs to serve you. People show stronger preference for environmental friendly in public. Puris is conscipicous altruism. Story of how ourWhy we got it important like a deal or pro social or story of subculture. Backpacking across Europe shows adventure. Alien makes us not be able to judge others based on things. Jewelry gone, cars entirely on worth over Hummer and brand, no fashion, no lawns. Variety drys up as individuality is signaling by another name. With all the money, we just spend it on prestigious gyms and education. Ads. Brand promise like Disney is family fun entertainment or conveys info like Zappos sells shoes. Lifestyle image ads is to associate soda with relaxing on the beach. People often don’t think it affects them but that it will affect others. If ad changes other people’s perception, it might make sense to buy it. If some lifestyle ads make you turn away from brand, there are prob ads that are having the opposite effect on you. If the social is important, lifestyle ad would be used specifically for conscpicois products. Not laundry detergent, but music and cars. And important about how mass media the ad is sent, larger continuous audience. Lifestyle also advertise to third party that don’t even purchase like to create envy for BMV.
- 11 Art
- All cultures do it, but its impractical and costly. Visual, performing, literature, body art, domestic design like food. We prefer waste because of what the waste says about the potential mate. Pinker calls music auditory cheesecake, so pleasurable but not useful. But art is old enough and universal enough, indicates its an adaption that is advantageous. Male bower bird make huge beautiful nest and decorate it and spend most of his time on it. Not used for actually nesting, just to attract females. Bower birds have female raise alone. But in humans, men and women both do art. Art is impressive display and we have many reasons to impress. Makes sense we express and enjoy art. Fitness display. Not just about Instrinic beauty, as we value art that took more effort. Imagine relic museum with same instrinic beauty, so makes sense as something more than a trigger for pleasure. 80% of people said they would rather see ashes of Mona Lisa than a relic of it burned. Your appreciation of an object could entirely depend on whether someone carved a sculpture or just found the seashell on the shore. We appreciate originality and difficult methods because it’s a fitness display. Look at how fair skin was once prized as sign of wealth before indoor jobs became norm then dark skin. Shows how instrinic beauty is super relative. Silver over aluminum and theater over movie. Photos changed painting into Impressionism over realism. Choosing to celebrate artist over utility. Therefore art needs to be impractical and nonfunctional. Waste advertised surplus. High heels, and old corsets and white dresses. Adaptive to calibrate which way is high status and rare. Since only trained ears can appreciate fine music, it’s also a fitness display to appreciate art and would be embarrassing to appreciate low status art.
- 12 Charity
- Peter singer noted you should save a child drowning in front of you and you have the exact same responsibility to save child in Africa. Eating out is moral equivalent of killing people since you could have donated money. Effective altruism origins went around asking charities about data of effectiveness and realized many charities didn’t have it. Give well. Strange conclusion like vaccines, particular parasitic worm, or give people money directly. Save live for 3.5k. Some complaints that give well  likes charities that have narrow measurable impact. 9 out 10 donate to charity in US. More than 395B, It’s amazing how far charity is from effective altruism. Biggest recipients are churches and universities(which arguably worse. 85% care about nonprofit performance and only 3% do comparative research and don’t really care about what it would use the money for. Scope neglect, people will in to donate same amount despite scale of impact. People also prefer many small donations. Wealthy give cheap labor instead of their highly skilled labor. Warm glow theory. Giving makes us happy and more smaller donation better. Why does it feel good? 5 things that influence charity:1) viability give more while being watched 2) peer pressure, responds strongly to social influences 3) Proximity Give more locally than globally 4) relatable, give more of people identifiable 5) mating motive, give more if primed with mating motive. 1, give more when 2 solicitors or give eye contact and can see their donation. Bands or stickers to short generosity on sleeve. Anonymous donors at least discuss in their social groups. 2 peer pressure. People donate when they ask for money especially if close to you. 95% given in response to solication. 3) care about proximity both social and physically. People have distinct preference for their own country. 2011 298B of US and only 13% went to foreigners.  4) Relatable better if there is a name, face, and story. A single death is a tragedy but a million is a statistics. [Kiva.org](http://kiva.org/) specific stories asking for real money. Mosquito nets only save statistically life, not individual. 5) mating motive.  Men more likely to give to charity donate if solicited by attractive female or more females around. 2007. Men primed by asking them to imagine real first date va control. Men were way more likely to report conspicuous altruism. Obvious we want to be seen as charitable, Motive to appear generous. One of primary audience is potential mates and stinginess isn’t sexy as child charities especially celebrated. We celebrate generously of our own sex and even when married or old. Charity also about social and political gatekeepers. Most obvious thing to advertise is wealth, I have money to give away!! And pro social orientation, people who will look out for us. Leaders for immediate communities and can be antisocial for mayor to help other county’s. Explains why we support charities public ally known to be good as best charities after research are private knowledge. Profoundly useful to sponeteously help those around you and great trait to advertise as great ally. Russel: “mark of civilized man is to read column of numbers and weep”. Sponentous generosity great for mates and allies. Missing charity: Giving to people in far future, atluisa trust like Ben Franklin letting compound interest scale for 100 years. Marginal charity to nudge decisions to be better. Real social incentives vs empathy. Need to make charity more rewarding for donors by advertising most effective charities and celebrate effective altruism.
- Education
- Education is to learn and improve yourself. Most of this is from the case against education. Can sneak on campus to take classes and they don’t care, so easy to steal this education if so valuable just without a degree. Students trying to learn, would be sad to miss class or easy classes. Want easier path to degree over learning. Sheepskin effect as degree is way more important than any year. Each year besides senior year worth 4% more salary vs senior worth 30%. Waiters and bartenders earn like 50% more if college degree, pay so much for unused learning. Most of what we learn like science and advanced math or foreign language and history barely used in careers. Many college degrees rarely used after school. College could help achieve well rounded students, but authors let skeptical. Cram not learning. American adults only 3% speak foreign language well, as a result of school, only 32% know atoms bigger than electron. Does it teach how to learn or think critically, but research shows people learn narrowly and don’t apply across. Not interleaved learning with late morning starts. Education way better individually than nationally. Individual students can expect income to rise 8-12 per additional year of school and nations only 1-3 percent per year increase of their citizens. Signaling explanation: to show off work potential. Iq isn’t the whole story because we have iq tests. Consciousness, willingness to meet expectation, etc. can only be demonstrated with consistent performance. Kind of person who can beat peers in a structured environment. School didn’t make people better, but just let them show traits they already have. Certification that makes value clear to buyers like a gem appraisal that puts it through tests. Estimates 80% of value of education is this signaling. Busy work better for this signaling process. Exit exam to get knowledge retention for employers? Nah. Explains diff between nation and individual value of education, competition of school. Harvard hard work done by admission officers. Seems like there could be better signaling ways like apprecenticeship and getting paid, but equilibrium our culture converged on. College great network, dating. 28% of married college grads attended same college as spouse and more likely to marry other college grads. Also act of consumption for parties and clubs. Expensive low ranked private schools may be more conspicuous consumption signaling status, wealth, and personal qualities. Other effects: propaganda and domestication. Prussian schools about creating good soldiers and emulated everywhere. Nationbuilding project especially in civic and history learning. Governments with more totalarian tend to fund schools and media more. Domestication as work is long with system of rewards. Few men in history took orders from others and egalitarian. Teachers reward displinced even if conflicts with learning. Unschooled workers and countries tend to do worse in regular jobs and factories historically. Refuse to work harder or more machines and follow orders. Can make less violent, more cooperative and social norms. Prepare for society by break our forager spirits.
- 14 Medicinef
- 17% of gdp in us is spent on healthcare. Supply and demand. Most of exploration is about the supply side, but why do we want so much healthcare is it really to be healthy.
- Kiss the booboo, is elaborate ritual so friends and company can get loyalty. Conspicuous caring, all the healing going on covers it. In some areas, make food not but food to shore you care for sick family. E we didn’t always have real medicine, but caring of sick is always a thing in foragers as food is perishable you need help. So conspicuous support can be politically good to avoid rivals in time of weakness. In Egypt and healers, complex specialists of high status individuals were always a thing even when the treatments did nothing or were harmful. King treatments were so harmful and difficult. Jobs condemned for not seeking the best care for himself, “practically committed suicide with his focus on alternative medicine”. Vaccines work. But does conspicuous caring motive is half or 10th as important as actually healing. If it was more important, you would expect people to do more medicine than they need even when harmful or cost too much. We will focus on marginal that is extra not routine that cost more. Higher spending in regions even when controlled don’t improve health. More medical spending doesn’t improve health. Longer icu treatments patients leave 40 FEWER days. RCT 1980s Rand, 5.8k given different medical subsidies. Free medicine became 45% more medicine. No detectable health difference between groups. Marginal medicine didn’t seem less useful to medical doctors like unneeded surgery so doctors couldn’t tell difference between the records. Lottery winners felt healthier(placebo?) and less depression, also get more medicine but no health benefit. US could cut medicine by third and be fine. Most scholars don’t see medicine as biggest life expectancy increase, plausibly more important is sanitation, better nutrition, and safer jobs/lives. This is about marginal medicine not any medicine though. Don’t we hear about great medicinal advancements, well well accepted most medical studies are wrong. 49 most cited articles in most prestigious journals, only 20 were confirmed. Marginal medicinal treatments often have side effects even if they are beneficial. Maybe health is so important we will do anything. Conspicuous caring perditions: 1) Keeping up with Jones, spend more if neighbors spend more. Shown to be true across countries. Makes sense if social benefits 2) preference for difficult, conspicuous medicine. People like best doctors over more sleep and exercise. Asking for lesser care, abandoning your parents how could you. 3) People don’t really care about info about institutions or doctors 4) We dont like questioning effectiveness of healthcare. More people die from medicine error 44-90k deaths a year. More  than breast cancer, aids, and highway accidents. Yet no reforms like autopsy or catheter use, hand washing(compliance 40%). rarely seek second opinions. Exercise live 15 years longer if exercise a lot and rural areas live 6 years longer. Taken all these things together , suggest we are less interested in health and more interested in care that third parties will appreciate.
- PPPP I don’t buy this healthcare, it could be wasteful for other reasons. It’s interesting though.
- 15 Religion
- In few domains more deluded about our motives . Self serving logic to even most earnest religious activity. Fasting, chastity, missionary work, donation, and self mutalistion seems very counter productive. Strange supernatural beliefs. Could say we do weird things because it’s the beliefs. Belief first model. When argue about beliefs implicit that belief is cause of religious participation but perhaps symptoms of underlying social motives. Not all religious don’t have such doctrine like Islam and Christian more about ritual, cultural participation. Islam pray is religion and pledge to flag is patriotism. Frats, sports teams, have same behavior patterns. People like religion and authors like to give people the benefit of the doubt that they know what they are doing. Report greater happiness, more socially adjusted, marriage and have more children. Religions as social systems. Community, community, community. Social incentives so people act selfishly to benefit entire community creating cohesive and cooperative group. Ripe for exploration, so need robust mechanics to keep cheaters at bay. Religion got great social tech.
- Sacrifice, loyalty, and trust. Sacrifice is socially attractive, what someone who will help others. God often functions as symbol to society, sacrifice to group. Barriers to entry ensure only most devoted are committed. Sacrifice health, food, time. Weird clothes or dietary preferences gain standing in sect but lose it grander society. More important positions require more sacrifice. Social rewards limited so need a holier than thou focus. Sacrifice also increase trust and cooperation. We use contracts now, before about sacrifice to community. Americans would rather vote a a Muslim over an atheist.
- Prosocial norms. Charity commitment keeps less committed out. Monitoring and punishment pretty common from shunning. The more you put in and closer you are to the community the more costly shunning is. Monogamy and early marriage benefit from stronger marriage norm. Everyone can believe in child rearing and long term commit. Liberal mating is more about delaying marriage and less children and more career focused. Sync movements people cooperated more in future games. Attending sermon says sermon is valuable, institution is legitimate. About learning together and common knowledge of community norms, so can be mutually accountable. Preacher speaks out about birth control that wedges itself into community perspective. Badges quickly share information with strangers. Jew hat says we share norms to Jews and I represent Jewish people and thus will be punished if I act badly so you can trust me. Religious not particularly useful for knowing, but about social value. People who believe in god punishment more likely to be norms, and should show to others, best way to convince others is to actually believe it. Some beliefs political about authority and others could just serve as a badge. Beliefs as attire about transmutation and reincarnation. High costs of joining religious community because belief system can be ridiculed. Not joining a club. Celibacy and martyrdom about social status. Sacrifice in one domain to gain in another, hill climbing. Hill climbing accidents like sugar or drug chasing, not necessarily maladaptive.
- 16 Politics
- Small scale coalition politics in the past chapters. But we will explore grand statecraft of ordinary citizens. Doright people all about hard nosed pragmatists about doing what’s best for their country. People mostly don’t vote for their self interest. Young men likely to be drafted not against military escalation or parents for school support. Work of learning and voting but personal impact is tiny.
- Puzzle 1: disregard for vote decisiveness like in string states. 1k fold difference. Should be eager in a swing state. Real voters don’t care only increase 1-4% and so many vote in non swing state.
- Puzzle 2: uniformed voters . People would be embarrassed to be uninformed if it’s just a coin flip. Only 29% can name their congressmen and pretty ignorant. Uninformed voters over experts have antiforeign, anti market, prssististic bias underestimate value of economic progress. People often asked months apart and give different answers. Real voters don’t really care about practical details more about high minded rhetoric.
- Puzzle 3: New info and perspective should be welcomed if the truth and impact is what we cared about. Extremely critical of other views.
- Soviet 1930, extreme ideological support Stalin appartic. People cheer for Stalin for 10 minutes, who is gonna sit down first and be looked down on our arrested by the secret police. “There’s a special place in hell for women that don’t help each other”. A performance. 49%R and 33% D would be upset if their child married someone else. R academics less prestigious institutions. Can lose friends in polite company.
- Politics is about signaling loyalty. Instrumental voting is to influence outcomes or expressive voters about voting, happy to cast their ballot with social rewards. Secret ballot, means expressing political opinions is where the value is so around the election. If voting was selfishly valuable, it wouldn’t be a great loyalty signal. No joy or social rewards in questionnaire matching to candidate. Loyalty demands strategic irrationality. We might demand equal opportunity then fiercely compete for schools. Compromise isn’t loyalty. 80%  correlation got political beliefs with one main dimension across countries and groups. When collapse shows agenda and reform. Even suicide terrorists don’t compromise and care about group. “Others may care more about being smart then being loyal”.
- Chapter 17 Conclusion
- Profess noble but many innoble in back. What to do with this to live better lives? Part 1 we ignore because it’s strategic so we don’t look so selfish. Benefits is better situational awareness. Wastes of social time can be beneficial. Maybe health or ads are about what other people thing. We often misunderstand how we think. See ourselves as others see us. Avoid accusing others of selfish, use forst and third person. Talking candidly about human behavior signal some attractive qualities, honesty, courage, and intellectual ability. Change your community. Culture that rewards the right things. Tension between selfish and pro social can be painful, better when both are the same. Cynical cooperate less, this book may induce selfishness or community forms with better norms. Virtue must arrive through our biological selves. Enlightened self interest(Adam smith), we can do good for ourselves by doing good for others. Competitive altruism. Designing policies should take hidden motives into account and not mistake professed motives for real motives. Testing is important for schools and could tax wasteful extra healthcare. Try to acknowledge peoples need to show off and direct their in a way that is useful. Perspective to understand this, humans are who we are and have always been this way with great depth. Helping people can be motives by selfishness but behavior is not and we shouldn’t conflate these virtues. Social life actually reward truth and helping others. US space race, altruist competed our way to the god damn moon.
