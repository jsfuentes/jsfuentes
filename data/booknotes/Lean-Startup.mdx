Intro

Fed up with traditional methods.  Are customers for input,  but more likely to run experiments on them then listen. Entrprenuership is building new things in extreme uncertainty. Exist to learn not make something. 3.I  Validatef learning 4. Build mesdure learn 5. Innovation accounting. Can't just do market research anymore.

Measure

Measure by how much you learned create cross-functional teams. Startups often make products no one wants so actual productive is irrelevant. Instead of making complex plans, make constant adjustments with build measure learn. Startups have a vision a direction and to reach out they employ a strategy with a business model, roadmap and point of view about who customers are. Product is end result. Need failure to learn in startups.

Define

Startup is institution designed to create product under extreme uncertainty. So intraorenuers too, those with big companies. The innovator dilemma, companies became good at serving existing companies do sustained innovation, not disruptive innovation through new growth.

**Learn**

Why does it matter if you are on time if no body wants it? Launch a buggy infested project just to get market validation. Find out mental model for how people work, assumptions faulty. Throw away all the work. What is validated learning and what is waste? Experiments are better than surveys. All people to downloaded so that doesn't exist. Imvu I wanted to create 3d avatars for all IM clients, but they actually wanted just a single IM client and single I'm buddy list because they used many ckients. Validated learning is demonstrated in core metrics.

Audacity of zero

Zero almost a better metric because it could become anything. Weak metrics don't Indore the same hope.

Which features? When are customers right? True experiment starts with hypothesis and prediction about what will happen. Experiment better than surveys because:

More accurate data

Interacts with real customers

Allows itself to be surprised by customers

Experiment is first product that gives potential customers. Before deciding to make something answer 4 questions:

It's it a problem

If they was a solution would they but it

But it from is

Can we build it

Doesn't slip to 4

Su

Minimize total time in build measure learn loop.
