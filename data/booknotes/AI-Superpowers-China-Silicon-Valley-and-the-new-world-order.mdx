#Book by [[Kai-Fu Lee]] 2018
Introduction
- author VC talking about AI around world
- China used to lag years if not decades, but now huge enthusiasm from business to government to elementary schools
- China is the only real counterweight to US for AI future
1 Chinas Sputnik movement
- 2017 AlphaGo by Google beats worlds best in Go
	- Go was Zen like art form in China 
- Google, FB, Apple dominated world
- VC office in Beijings Silicon Valley, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongguancun
- For China, Go was Sputniks moment that put fire on AI in China, not as big as Sputnik in us but still
- 2 months after alphago win, China gov set 2030 as becoming AI leader 
- Author was PhD at Carniege Mellon in AI and he built program to beat world class in simplified go, 1983
- deep learning offers new tech, the threat to job replacement will hit across income levels
- Go best player player 3 hour matches, he cried at one point, that’s how he is the peoples  championship offering hope for our future
- 1983 PhD rule based vs neural network
	- 1969 rule base in favor over neural network
	- Neural network need compute and data, but recently changed with internet and moores law
- mid 2000 Gregory Hilton found way to efficiently train layers in neural network, now deep learning 
- 2012 hilton SOTA in CV ml and deep learning blew up
- need data, clear goal, 
	- Deep learning is narrow to optimize for a pattern
- 2013 Google bought Hilton and deep mind 
- 2016 China didn’t wake up til now
- China is not just a copycat anymore, China will be biggest beneficiary 
- deep learning is in age of implementation of just using model to turn it into companies
	- Now we will see business 
- Age of progress was Us and Canada with a few geniuses, but now we have deep learning already
- now data is the core, advantage China
	- 4 inputs needed, Abundant data, good gov policies, entrepreneurs, ai scientists
- worked at Apple Microsoft and Google and author can say Silicon Valley sluggish compared to China
	- China has most cutthroat market with opponents copying and speed essential
		- Must keep innovating and make moat
		- in Silicon Valley people don’t copy as much so less innovation
- China has huge data of volume
	- 2013 China started making new products
		- WeChat, online to offline change of all commerce
			- Way more real world data
- China gov made beacon to local governments
	- Regions compete to lure AI startups
	- Us cuts funding for research
- China will prob soon match or overtake US in AIand we will see “productivity gain on scale not seen since Industrial Revolution”
- PWC says AI development will 15.7 T and China expected to take 7 T of value double North America gain
- US doesn’t know what’s it’s like to be behind 
- Job loss and inequality will wipe out billions of jobs, but nothing happened as quickly 
- “I predict that within 15 years, AI will technically be able to replace 40-50% of jobs in US”
	- Job shock will be very real and large and soon
	- Astronomical wealth in Ai tycoons 
- AI has huge winner take all with data 
- Uk France and Canada don’t have funding
- AI in factories will take away one advantage poor countries have, cheap labor
	- Move factories with robots closer to people and pull away ladder for poor, huge gap between have and have nots 
- real threat of AI is tremendous social disorder and political collapse from widespread unemployment and gaping inequality
	- psychological loss of one’s purpose
		- Author has loss purpose recently too and had learnings

	- coliseum in China to win market fought aggresively
		- smear campaigns reported ceo to police, crazy work ethic 
	- Cut throat entrepreneur environment, profit hungry gladiator and tycoons 
- entrepreneur in US had liberal arts too and son of rich business
	- techno optimism that every person and company can change the world with innovative thinking
		- copying ideas is frowned upon as pure innovation better
	- More mission driven detached from earthly concerns
- China is market driven, make money in whatever product or business that will accomplish it
	- Not fame or glory but prize is rich, deep rote and perfection and copying is culturally deep
	- one kid so 4 parents, more about earning money to take care of parents and rote memorization
	- Scarcity

- China artisan copied clocks that came from west then made it better
	- Knock off disneyland and luxury good factories 
	- in a few months, mini iPhones within few months of iPhone that couldn’t even connect to network
- Silicon Valley more about one thing and do it well globally, so any divergence between Chinese preference and us product became opening
- Free is not a business model
	- Alibaba, guerilla against eBay for 5 years 
		- Alipay and freemium while eBay charged for listing

			- yellow pages, find one thing and click it
		- China look upper left and 30-60 seconds clicking all results
			- Shopping mall, try different things as first taste of so much info
	- Google should not navigate away(kick out of mall), Baidu opened new page on click
		- Google had lengthy forking code, author fought for months to change
- why silicon valley giants fail in China?
	- Author thinks it’s not gov, it’s the companies approach, Airbnb Google Uber
		- they treat China as any other country to just market their product, don’t invest the resources, freedom and flexibility to compete with world class entrepreners
	- most ambitious people join startups, hit ceiling of regional manager at big tech
- Weibo like Twitter worth more than American company
- Dede, gives more rides than Uber

- In US first mover can win cuz people don’t like just copying
- China had 5k Groupon copycats
	- Wang had 3rd try serial entrepreneur with his other veterans
		- wang went on iteration instead of subsidizing and ads, let other educate market and spend money as users would just jump to best deal
		- pioneered paying partners faster
	- Groupon partnered with tencent and consultants, Groupons standard playbook with acquisition cost way more expensive and iteration too slow
	- 3 companies left after fight, wang pivoted to new markets with food delivery, domestic tourism, market driven lean startup, movie tickets
- AI will be harnessing of electricity in China, and big data is the oil
3 chinas alternate internet universe
- author started VC incubators
	- 3 years free if they move to specific region
	- What if they speed it up of SVC? Clear out a street and bring everyone together, go really wanted to help

- now we talk Ai expertise and gov support
- Quantity of ai more important than quality, China got an army
	- While us has superstars, China has armies who team up with us
- open source AI allows global progress 
- 7 giants of AI - Google, FB, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent split between US and China
	- billions in talent and power grids of compute
- China subsizes ai startups, mayors driverless trucking, city brains, facial recognition 
	- China techno ultiutarian supports wasteful optimistic spending more than Us
- Nobel winners and no name tinkers

- Shouldn’t Chinese control hobble innovation? 
	- in hard science, scientists pretty far
	- Eric from google “believe me these people are good”
- companies unique breakthrough will probably have a lid on it so threat to China and open ai ecosystem
	- China has edge in entrepreneurship, data, and gov support
	- author thinks another breakthrough is unlikely to occur in big companies, deep learning too big a breakthrough
- google vs rest
	- Google has best shot head and shoulder, google rd bigger then the government 
		- Among best ai researchers, half at Google

Four waves of AI
- iFly tech could make presidents speak Chinese, decent lip sync
	- Beats US in NLP
	- 1999 Microsoft research Asia top is lui chi fung, declined offer cause he wanted to start AI speech company that was ifly
		- author told him China was too far behind US
- 4 waves, each with different data needed
	- Internet aI, already here with attention
	- Business ai, trading stock/illness
	- perception ai, experience and interact blur lines between digital and physical
	- Autonomous ai, last with deepest impact with robots, drone, and driving

		- Tried to buy Reddit, but got musically 
	- us and China 50-50, in 5 years perhaps 40-60 lead china
	- Users are automatically labeling data as they browse and click
- business ai
	- labeled data from business on accepting apps, stock prices, mortgage defaults, etc
	- AI can outperform humans looking at tons of data points instead of human looking at most important
	- us companies use lots of enterprise software with labeled data, but China never fully embraced common entreprise software
		- Many Chinese companies still run like fiefdoms and way less outside consultants
	- Where ai can leapfrog legacy, china excels
		- leapfrogging credit cards to Alipay caused need for credit, 
			- smart finance, access data on phone instead of salary, micro loans using every feature 
	- medical diagnosis, by far best doctors in best cities so long hospital lines in Beijing
		- ex thinking is startup for diagnosis copilot driven by doctor that asks questions and percent chance of diagnosis 
		- **“let’s all doctors and nurse focus on the human tasks that no machine can do: making patients feel cared for and consoling them when diagnosis isn’t bright** (lol)

			- camera tracks student attention and engagement and feeds student profile
		- HW/grading
			- speech recognition for language 
			- auto grading
			- Parents can get remote tutoring that match you to other human tutors, but now watched by AI 
		- China parents pouring money gives them leg up on US
	- China more accepting of giving up privacy especially with public surveillance, so huge headstart
	- greatest industrial advantage in China is not cheapest labor, but industrial engineers and speed of iteration
		- crazy variation of part suppliers and factories, week in Schenzen is month in US
		- xiaomi, me speaker like echo with half price for smart home
	- clear edge China 60-40 with lack of privacy and manufacturing 5 years 80-20
- Autonomy’s ai
	- start with factories and farms, automated but not autonomous where they can make decisions or irregularities with CV
	- Strawberry still hand picked until now machine delicately doing with sight

	- Silicon valley likes making one global product for everyone, but China investing into home grown startups
	- Dede funds all of Ubers enemies around the world and offer support
	- China vs us will have proxy competition global markets
6 utopia, dystopia, and the rea ai crisis
- all ideas reached do not need breakthroughs and implementation and tinkering with data and fields
- superintelligence, singularity, 
- Author thought speech recognition was 5 years away, but was off by 20 years
- jobs and inequality crisis incoming across economic classes, and global economic inequality
	- folding Beijing imagines different economic classes living in seperate space, dystopia
- some predict AI crisis is Luddite fallacy
	- while some lost wages, but children and grandchildren better off
	- looms, ATMs, yet still stable employment
- different levels of tech advancements improve task(typewriter), eliminate need for labor(calculator), or change industry (cotton gin) or general purpose technology 
- GPT, general purpose tech, from second machine age book 
	- Interrupt and disrupt tech progress
	- 3 techs: steam engine, electricity, and computing/info like computers and internet
		- Change how we live and work across industries
	- Steam engine, 1760-1830, first industrial reV and Electricity, 1870-1914, 2nd industrial rev
		- deskilling, took skilled tasks like textile making to low skilled like operating loom 
		- While some experts displaced, empowered huge low skill workers from like farmers and increased pie and living standards
	- over past  30 years, us had great decoupling, increased productivity but stagnant growth in median income and employment
		- 1% wealth doubled from 1980 and 2016, 
		- real wages flat 
		- Computer is skill bias, let top performers be high leverage
- AI will be a GPT on scale of industrial rev but faster
	- PWC expects AI to add 15.7 T by 2030, gdp of China today, mostly to China and us
	- AI will perform many intellectual and physical tasks fast
		- Took over tasks optimized with data and don’t require social interaction
	- 3 ways faster than industrial rev
		- mostly digital algs that can just be replicated instantly for free
		- VC will throw money for crazy ideas
		- China 1/5 of world is on level of West and contributing 
- what jobs are at risk, how bad will it be?
	- AI great at narrow, but can’t interact with people, have dexterity of limbs, creative cross domain complex strategy
	- Physical and Cognitive graph
		- X for physical Low dexterity structured environment to high dexterity unstructured env X
		- Y is social to asocial
		- X for cognitive graph, optimization on data based on clear variable left to strategy and creative based
		- Bottom left danger, and top right safe
			- Psychritrist, home care nurse least likely (lol)
		- Task diversity complicates within a task
	- Humans will act as social interface for customers like teacher, bartender, medical care giver 
	- Plumber, construction, and graphic design will be chipped away 
	- Scientists and engineers will accelerate their progress
- How will AI affect economy? 10-20 years will be capable of doing 50% of jobs
	- Few look at Chinese markets
	- 2013 Oxford said 47% of jobs could be automate in next decade
		- Technically possible to do with machines
	- 2016 oecd said 9% can be replaced, entire occupations won’t be done but instead tasks based 
	- 2017 PWC did task based and said 38% of jobs were at risk in Us by early 2030s, what jobs could be done
	- author worked with Mczeie said 50% of work tasks already automatable but said 30% of work could be automated by 2030 but only 14% would need to change occupancy 
	- What studies missed?
		- Technical capabikities underestimate, Oxford asked ml experts and used 2013 estimates of future capabilties
			- goal posts moved with unexpected improvements
			- Deep learning 2012 image net jump with 18% error rate, now less than 5% better than humans
		- task based also looks for one to one replacement, but could be disruptive startup
			- Robot that can work in warehouse(task based)
				- PWC got this estimate
			- Reimagine industry, smart finance that has no human lenders or Amazon go 
				- Could add 10% especially for industry with routine optimization with customer service, Fast food and radiology
	- 10-20 years will be capable of doing 40-50% of jobs
		- Legal and social intertia will up to half this so unemployment between 10-25%
	- other workers will have automation of work load will decrease bargaining power
	- Bain 2018 demographics, automation, and inequality
		- Concluded 2030 employers will need 20-25% fewer employees
		- If we include displacement and wage suppression, will affect 80% of workers
- some think China will probably be hit much harder, with many on farmers and industrial
	- Intelligent robotics will bring manufacturing back to us cuz closer to customer
		- Martavichize paradox, far harder to get toddler sensory motor skills than many intellectual tasks
- but author thinks intelligence automation will hit white collar first, cuz easy to copy 
	- robotics will be slower
- China and U.S. will be hit similarly across larger timeline 
	- But will capture much of productivity gains cuz of winner take all of data and skill loops
	- Poor countries will stagnant as these two soar
- AI inequality machine
	- More winner take all dynamics across all industries by adding data
	- increase skill and income gap with bifucturated job market
	- create the useless class, people who can’t enough create economic value to support themselves
- crisis of meaning
	- After losing job, people lose their sense of worth and meaning triple depression after unemployment 3x
		- Depths of despair, more suicide risk
	- People won’t just be unemployed, they will permanently out of economy as robots outperform them at tasks they spent their whole life 
The wisdom of cancer
- author threw all time at work with worth about work achievements and influence
	- his life became optimization about input, about spending minimum time with wife and kids
	- Top AI researchers in world, huge VC
	- 2013 stage 4 lymphoma and nothing be optimized could save him
- he began spending more time with wife and about helping younger
	- Life is not optimizing influence, but about sharing love with those around you
- if we match economic value to our worth, we will be devastated economically and mentally
- 1991 author had kid same day he would have Apple CEO meeting for speech recognition
	- optimizing, kid will be born if your not there but speech recognition could not be approved. But actually made both
	- 1992 would demo voice commands for appointments and write check
- 2013, time 100 most influential person
	- Wrote books and gave speeches across China to inspire about being your personal best, author wanted to be scientist and business executive that would make products for everyone
	- switched to teacher/VC cuz he cares right
- 2013 53 diagnosed, all about how did O do this cuz I tried to be good
	- then began being less egocentric and asked sad he didn’t take time to share love with others
	- most common regrets are not living life true to themselves and too much work but spending time with those they love
	- Optimization about min time he could spend to get goal was robbing him of humanity
- at zen temple, head monk asked what he wanted and author responded change the world and maximize impact
	- “when people speak in this way it’s often nothing but a thin disguise for ego, for vanity.”
	- love gives us true life, we aren’t meant to optimize. To live it, we must recognize nothing more valuable than loving others
- he had stage 4 lymphoma cancer, but stage 4 about main features not sub features with subtle correlations that more informative about outcomes
- author sought to not be productive machine and cherish time
	- treat all equally
- No alg that can replace family love during cancer, ai can’t replace love
	- “Humans are uniquely able to love and be loved. Humans want to love and be loved. Loving and being loved are what make our lives worthwhile.”
8 blueprint for human coexistence in ai
- for elderly, touchscreen next to bed with simple apps like delivery, tv remote, and customer service to talk you through etc
	- customer service overwhelmed, wanted someone to talk to
- humans can give love, very far from feeling emotion
	- her was acted by someone who knew how to convince you of love
- within 2030, will see massive pressure on employment
	- identity is in productive wage earning work
- shift to valuing human love, service, and compassion
	- Could just go UBI so people don’t starve/homeless but not enough
	- Should promote socially productive activities instead of economic productive like now
- 40 years China seen tech help everyone, US had seen decline in many segments
	- So China harder to convince of coming wave
- Reduce work hours, retrain worker, redistribute outcomes; 3 policies that don’t change culture
	- Retrain, future of online learning like Coursera to retrain continuously as AI replaces jobs, every few years
	- Reduce hours, Larry page thinks 4 day work week, and more work sharing
		- 2008 is states went for work sharing where companies would reduce hours by half and gov would compensate part of lost wages, saved money for unemployment 
		- But down mobility for most workers cuz lost wages
	- redistribute, 
		- UBI vs UM, Um is universal minimum so just minimum you can make
		- YC has Oakland test of UBI
		- SV elites looking for quick fix cuz they the target
		- UBI avoids messy details and just incentive change
- ai do analytical thinking and humans wrap in warmth and compassion
	- patients don’t want to be treated by machine, doctors become compassion care giver going into psychologist, social worker, 
		- more doctors so more care similar in law and education
	- new jobs like life coach, home sustainability consultants or season changes for wardrobe 
		- They just don’t pay well
- companies and impact investing need to support the creation of new service jobs
- ai elite of crazy wealth and UBI for rest is not what author wants
- social investment stipend - care, community service, education
	- Decent gov salary for people who create kind, compassionate, creative society 
	- care could be for parents or kids, education can be you taking classes 
	- lines and amounts and paying for and monitoring is work, but author thinks it’s worth
