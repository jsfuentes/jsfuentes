#Book by [[Jonathan Rauch]]
- [[The Happiness Curve]]
    - Basically [[Happiness]] peaks in youth around teenage years, progressive dip in mid 40s, and then rising happiness peaking in 70s. Data shows this trend across humans with longitudinal studies, cultural studies, and evidence in other apes. 
    - Happier people hit the turning point soonest around 47 in us and 62 in russia.  ^4f5b34
    - Remember this is statistical and not true for everyone. Can have steadily rising lines or dramatic life crashes
    - Dip isn't depression, more dissatisfied and dissatisfied about being dissatisified. Scray when you have more then you thought you ever wanted, but still don't find satisification.
    - Wisdom, he says, is balanced, reflective, active — “the happiness curve is a social adaptation, a slow-motion reboot of our emotional software to repurpose us for a different role in society.”
    - [[Midlife Crisis]] has little data backing it up, but could be explained as recognition of death If it did it, it could be a recognition of death after you stop growing up and are accomplished
    - Explanations
        - It is the unseen bend in the river, which makes it so depressing. [[Happiness]] has declined and we have no reason to think it could increase.
        - Encounters with brutal mid life like death can make that midlife crisis expalinable and make you progress through that trough faster.
        - Sadness hits you from both sides
            - Around 40, a person can realize they hit the peak of their external [[Success]], [[Creativity]] and [[Intelligence]]. Your best years are behind you
            - Expectation life will only get worse in the [[Future]]
            - Life Satisfaction = how you feel now - sum of regret. 
        - Switch from personal [[Ambition]] to [[Relationships]] as you age.
- [[Cognitive Biases]]
    -  Demonstrately people don't do things that increase their well beings. 
    - [[Loss Aversion]] - people would buy a mug for $3, but if you gave them a mug and asked how much would they sell it for average $7
    - Young adults overestimate happiness in 5 years by 10 percent
    - Discontentment without a cause has a negative feedback loop
        - You are embarrassed by your discontentment so you don't get support 
        - "There's something wrong with me". 
        - Discontentment is real life and doesn't go away. 
        - How can even tangible achievements not inspire gratitude and contentment for more than a week? Maybe discontentment is part of my personality.
    - 80 percent of people have [[Optimism Bias]]
        - Think they will be happier, be more successful, live longer than average. 
        - People are better at assimilating positive news. 
        - Mildly depressed people are more realistic. 
        - [[Hope]]/[[Optimism ]] keeps minds at ease, and leads to [[Success]] independent of other factors.
- [[Happiness]]
    - What is [[Happiness]]?  
        - Happiness is a momentary mood, evaluative happiness or subjective happiness is contentment/life satisfaction
        - Income matters until a certain point until it becomes comparative
        - Rise in others incomes hurts happiness
        - Norway made income data public in 2001 
            - People did 1/5th as many income searches as YouTube searches. 
            - Happiness inequality grew by 29%. 
    - Rational thoughts are a person on top of an elephant
        - You can either argue it's direction or face disappointment. 
        - [[Disgust]] influences our rational mind rather than the other way around
        - Elephant doesn't require energy or [[Willpower]]
        - Keep your eye on the gut and the reasoning follows
        - What does elephant want? 
            - [[Money]] is applause. 
            - [[Social Capital]] is social well being. 
            - [[Happiness]] is not the goal of life, reproduction and status is
    - [[Wealth]] and [[Happiness]]
        - People that gained [[Wealth]] in the last 10 year's seem to think they are doing worse and the people who didn't think they are better or same. 
        - Richer people are happier than poorer people
        - But richer countries aren't much happier. [[Happiness]] is relative
        - Economic elite are increasingly separating themselves into their own societies.  
    - Parenting while it is happening reduces life satisification especially early. Has high and lows. Always compare downwards. 
    - Achieving [[Happiness]]
        - Mental reward of [[Success]] is a short term positive step not huge goals
        - [[Happiness]] progress principle: Pleasure comes more from making progress towards goals than achieving them. 
        - [[Happiness]] adaption principle: We create world of targets with infinite goals adapting to our situation. 
        - [[Hedonic Treadmill]]: Given either principle of happiness, we can conclude it doesn't really matter what happens to you. 
        - Elephant looks towards others for how to gain prestige. 
            - Not aiming at happiness. Designed for drive to success. 
        - Contentment means you can stop. Create environment that you and elephant want, a sustainable [[Happiness]](social bonds). 
        - Life is about getting you and the ekpahnt to work in harmony. 
        - "I try to stay optimistic because if I didn't there wouldn't be much point in going on"- guy in his 40s that needs to stay in his job to provide his current lifestyle. 
        - Story of a guy who lives a simple life on a reservation, but feels a sense of meaning. Connection to other people, focused on just his small corner of the world that is concrete and visible, less interested in making a difference like World Peace.
- [[Old Age]]
    - Why does [[Old Age]] make us happy?
        - How much of aging isn't biology but reflection of how society treats us? 
        - We perceive aging to be a downward spiral into sadness as our body betrays us and we face dibillating disease and physical ailments. We watch people die in nursing homes and imagine we have nothing to look forward to
            - But, physical and mental health actually progress in the opposite direction
            -  All these things that people think makes them happy are backwards. 
            - More savoring than complacency and acceptance. 
            - Age seems to protect people from the emotional toil of a decaying body
            - Not numb from pain, its still felt, but feel it less and deal with it better
        - While young, we have memorable highs and lows. But people in the 50s, don't want to be 20 with its extremes. 
        - Perhaps aging helps people accept what they can't control
        - Perhaps we get better at dealing with stress
        - Evidence
            - [[Depression]] stopped turning up in old age
            - Older people feel less [[Regret]]
            - Peak happiness isn't until the 70s. 
    - [[Relationships]] in [[Old Age]]
        - Why don't old unsocial people make friends? 
            - They say they don't have time as in life time. 
        - They love their old friends and family so much. 
        - [[Relationship]] Study: 
            - Ask people who they would want to meet if they could meet anyone for 30 minutes
                - Old people choose close family/friends
                - Young people choose famous people
                - Old people told they have 20 years choose famous people more.\
            - Ask people who they would want to meet if they are leaving across the country, old people choose family 
        - Reigning explanation is the awareness of time, explore exploit. 
            - Old people more present oriented and prioritize really important people and relationships to find satisfaction. 
            - Maybe wouldn't want young people to have this because we need [[Ambitious]] [[Entrepreneurs]]
- Dealing with Happiness Dip
    - Social Stigma
        - Complaining can feel like a first world problem.
        - Sports car meme of middle life crisis with motorcycle or women. No one wants to be a punchline. 
        - Similar to gayness because if you lack a social narrative of how's it's normal then you internalize the [[Sterotypes]] that something is wrong with you
        - Are we getting an entire age group wrong?
    - Solutions
        - Need help from social norms and institutions that understand and help
        - Coaching
            - New middle age thing could be an industry
            - Ask clear powerful questions and assume person is not broken
            - Direct people to align their life with your goals.
            - [[Archive/JRoam/Therapy]] is like hiring a consulting for yourself or taking a class.
        - Middle Age [[Learning]] 
            - Our society is completely accepting of young college students going through an exploratory time, but surprised when other ages do it
            - Expectation that learning is completely front-loaded, despite this middle age new career and life stage. 
            - Imagine a world where we accept a mid life crisis as normal and have career retraining programs with no stigma
