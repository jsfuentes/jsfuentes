title: 'The untethered soul'
---

## Key Ideas:
- “Everything will be ok as soon as you are ok with everything, and that’s only time everything will be ok”
- “When your stuff gets hit, let go right then because it will be harder later. It won’t be easier if you explore it or play with hoping take the edge off. It won’t be easier to think about it talk about it” => Just sit in the highest seat of awareness and let go. The one who notices this pain is already free
- “spirituality begins when you decide you will never stop trying, spirituality is the commitment to go beyond no matter what it takes…if you are truly going beyond, you are always at your limits”
- “the purpose of your life is to enjoy and learn from your experiences, you were not put on earth to suffer. You aren’t helping anyone by being miserable”
## Part 1
- you are not the one talking but the one listening
	- You wonder which you you are, you say different things at different times, but you are none of them 
- So much of what voice says is meaningless
	- thinking and judging gives you perception of control
	- you already know it’s cold why verbalize, to be able to explain it
	- voice is protection
- instead of seeing problems to solve in outside world, see uncomfortable part of you on inside 
- Yoga isn’t about body but this insight
- Who are you? 
- Just see with consciousness, with awareness and no words or judgement and you know
	- Without awareness there is nothing 
	- Who are you is profound question and you are the answers, no intellectual
- most people have been to place somewhere in your life, where you have no way out and you feel you will stay there forever
- **breakup keeps you depressed in bed, she calls you and says she wants to see you and you get huge burst of energy but where did it come from**
	- **you block this energy by closing your mind or heart**
		- Energy centers are like chakras, chi, when you close them there is no energy
		- Feel open in their presence so you feel a lot of energy, then they do something you don’t like and there is a tightness 
- when your open you feel energy, all you have to do is not close
	- the only thing you want is to feel enthusiasm, love, and you get it when you are open
	- **Don’t let anything be important enough to close you** 
## Part 2
### Secrets of spiritual heart
- heart open we fall in love, closed we stop
-  blocked event makes you think about it constantly because you resisted
		- You should just experience a moment then hold the next
		- Blocked energy patterns block you and stay inside
		- sanskira inside you and if they build up sufficiently you depressed, and energy must pass through this depressive energy to enter you
- two ways to block, clinging and keep energy close or push energy away 
- if you don’t close you can have unending love, openness
- When you feel sanskira, take as opportunity to let it pass through you finally, purify
### Transcending the tendency to close
- survival instinct strongest, now about self concepts 
- all the time you learned to Close down and protect yourself, your ego 
	- If you protect yourself perfectly, you stagnate 
	- Must reach awareness of all parts of psyche
- the reward for not protecting self is liberation
- spiritual growth is about point where you feel energy change, when you feel some tightening or energy change that’s when you let go
	- the moment you realize heart get defensive just stop
	- Let thoughts go but don’t chase, consciousness watches it come and go but thought isn’t consciousness
		- Don’t try to change mind just watch thoughts
## part 3 freeing yourself
### chapter 8 let Go now or fall
- if you don’t like change, you try to create controllable world that doesn’t create fear
- we think we need to figure out how life should be then make it that way, but why does life have to be a certain way
	- we want life to be a certain way cause of fear is blockage of your energy and root of all anger and jealousy
	- don’t fight life and face fear causing you to fight
- **Life is surrounding you with people and situations to grow if you are willing to open your heart to everything and let purification process happen**
	- Situations triggering you let’s you process your stuff
		- Let it go
- what if you actually quit or yell, now it’s almost impossible to let go as you need to defend your actions and painting your environment and people around you with this energy
- energy when let go strengthens you rather than weakens you, don’t even turn towards disturbed energy but don’t move from your seat of awareness and open your heart
- **“When your stuff gets hit, let go right then because it will be harder later. It won’t be easier if you explore it or play with hoping take the edge off. It won’t be easier to think about it talk about it”** 
	- permit pain to come up into your heart and let go
- the fall into disturbed energy
	- Your consciousness distorted as everything looks dark and depressing, the moment you start seeing that you don’t like the people anymore or things let go
		- Let go! Takes serious work, blockage must run its course
		- start getting into survival instinct, the moment you let that out you become even more into the energy passing it on 
	- Blockage can hit other blockages, and have a life in darkness
- “The secret of the ascent is to always look up”
	- sit in seat of awareness, get up and let go, don’t rationalize blame and try to figure it out, let consciousness go to highest center it can go
### Removing your inner thorn
- you have painful Thorn on nerve, important decision in life is if you
	- make sure nothing touches it
		- Work of lifetime to solve, creative hard solutions 
		- Affects who you are comfortable with, where you can work, runs your entire life
	- take it out
- let’s say you have deep sense of inner loneliness or sensitive of physical appearance or mental prowess, a thorn
	- you can adjust your life to allow your thorns
	- You’ll marry the person who makes you feel less lonely, and the pain will be back when external situation changes
	- If anyone makes you feel less lonely you adjust your life accordingly
- REMOVE THE THORN, look within yourself and you can decide to be free
	- Talk because people are interesting not lonely
	- Relationships because you genuinely like them not because you need them
	- love because you truly love not because you need to avoid your inner problems
- How do you free yourself
	- you free yourself by finding yourself, these disturbances aren’t you
	- To free yourself, stop playing with them and let the disturbances arise and let them go 
		- You either avoid the disturbance  or suppress it 
	- when you see a couple, you feel lonely
		- Thorn was touched, instead notice that your consciousness was watching tv then feel emptiness. 
	- When disturbance arises, Notice how what’s noticing is different, the one who notices is already free
		- does posture change, explore the feeling, if you can do this you can be free
	- when you realize you can let disturbances pass you will be free and the world can’t touch you
- you are the in dwelling being
	- Awareness doesn’t fight it is just aware
### chapter 10 stealing freedom from your soul
- “the prerequisite to true freedom is to decide that you don’t want to suffer anymore, you must decide that you want to enjoy your life and there is no reason for stress, inner pain, or fear”
- when Buddha said all of life is suffering, he meant we spend everyday either feeling it or protecting ourselves from it
	- This is water, constant issues with your psyche
	- you don’t think about your body daily, but you think about your psychological well-being so much, “what if I get put on the spot”, inner suffering
- you think about protecting your psyche so much because it is not ok, and it doesn’t have to be that way
- think of the job you gave your mind:
	- your mind wants everyone to like you, everything you do makes people like you, I want only things I like And nothing I don’t like
		- Mind is like, I’m on the job 24/7 
- broken psyche has underlying fear and incessant neurotic thought
- most people try to fix inner problems by getting better at external games
- external change/relationships won’t change inner problems
- success means you never have to think about your psyche again, like your body, you don’t have to worry 
- when your mind tells you what you need to do to be ok, instead know “everything will be ok as soon as you are ok with everything, and that’s only time everything will be ok”
- your mind is a tool that can ponder great thoughts and help humanity, but you charged it with protecting yourself
	- Your are not the tool thinking, but behind the mind
	- It will stop if you withdraw your attention, “fall behind the noise”
- the only action you take is relax and release, don’t try to stop and be aware and let it go 
- Simple awareness tips
	- When you get in your car, stop and be aware you are spinning on a planet in empty space and don’t get involved in your melodrama
	- Trigger points to help you take inventory in heart, mind, shoulders
- goal is to be persistently in Seat of self, where world just unfolds
	- At some point you will realize it’s all heart and mind follows, the heart reacts before mind starts so just let go at heart level
- untether and get liberation 
### Chap 11 pain, the price of freedom
- **requirement for liberation is coming to peace with pain and desire for comfort and control**
	- You must be able to sit quietly and face disturbance even if you don’t like it
	- Inner pain is always there 
- Since you approach someone with fear of rejection, avoidance of pain will be where action comes from
- Pain comes from the heart
	- deep inside is pain always there that is not processes, and build layers
		- you care about your car and clothes as a layer above being accepted, go deeper
- you could walk around this world being free, and you must not be afraid of inner pain or disturbance or rejection
- “it can’t touch you unless you touch it”
- when faced with pain your heart closes, I don’t have to put up with this I’ll just walk away
	- Psychological structure around closed energy
- “when you feel pain just see it as energy” the. Relax and release
	- Relax your heart until you see the place it hurts, then relax and go even deeper
		- relax your shoulders and heart
		- If you close it will stay within you
	- It will always pass
	- Sometimes you will feel heat in your heart which is pain being purified, learn to enjoy that burning it’s the fire of yoga 🔥 
- there is pain in your heart that you put there and have kept it there so you never have to feel it
	- There is tremendous love and peace on the other side of that pain
- pain is price of freedom and the moment you are willing to lay that price you will no longer be afraid and feel everything at deeper level and see ocean of love
- Spiritual growth occurs when you are willing to pay the price of freedom
## Part 4 going beyond
### 12 taking down the walls
- at some point, it starts to become quieter 
- the more you sit in seat of consciousness, you wonder how to break out of psyche entirely, this is called enlightenment 
	- What is consciousness removed focus from sensory inputs and thoughts
- allegory
	- love a field so buy it to build house of your dreams, you make it a fortress that blocks out shutters and blinds so you never see outside, you accustomed to city life so you like it cuz field was kinda scary, you find it so safe and predictable you forget outside, only comfort becomes sense of protection and you find it dark, you find flashlight and love the darkness, then you find light of someone else and marry them, find book of outside life that has huge light, your whole philosophy and dreams based on living in confines of house
	- similarly, our consciousness is living inside of a tight house with only light created that we create. But house sitting inside light, house is made of thoughts and emotions and wall is your psyche 
		- You live in conceptual world, so only darkness is inside as you as so entranced by it 
		- Just walk towards fear, it forms boundary that you want to avoid, to get out you must go
			- **darkness and fear is really blockage of light**
	- you built a self concept and defend it
- if you find out your adopted, it shakes you to your core and you patch up the hole with thought like oh they were just as nice as real parents
	- we decorate wall with thoughts 
	- Your awareness can cover vast space, true freedom is outside wall
- Just stop defending fortress
### Chapter 13 far far beyond
- spirituality is going beyond yourself constantly, so no more limitations or boundaries
	- Everything is infinite, you create boundaries
	- you try to make unknown known, and this model is your reality and you fight if it isnt
		- if it’s bothering you it doesn’t capture reality
- someone leaves you or dies and your model collapses and you fight so hard to keep it, will be one of important learning experiences of life cuz models tenuous
	- To understand why you cling to model, see what happens when you don’t smoke or eat
		- Resist doing what makes you comfortable and layer after layer you will see why you do it
- when you wake up you see you are caged in comfort and have to not tell people what you think and stay on top of everything 
- “If you still have barriers, and you know what they are cuz you hit them everyday, you must be willing to go beyond them”
- **“spirituality begins when you decide you will never stop trying, spirituality is the commitment to go beyond no matter what it takes…if you are truly going beyond, you are always at your limits”** and constantly at the edge
- “eventually you will realize it cannot actually hurt you when to go beyond your psychological limit”
- train like athletes to relax through your edges, **“you end up loving your edges because they point your way to freedom. All you have to do is constantly relax and lean into them. Then one day when you least expect it, you fall through into the infinite”** 
### Chapter 14 Letting go of false solidity
- struggling to understand our psyche which changes according to external and internal stimulus 
	- But you seek hold and cling to control, though nothing is solid
- who clings?
	- Your sense of awareness is always there and never changes, it is aware of thoughts, sensations and geelinr
	- you are not your body or thoughts or emotions, you are awareness
- consciousness is dynamic field of awareness that can concentrate or expand
	- Can get lost in experience of movie forgetting body
- as you cling to more and more thoughts you use it to define concept of self as it’s there, constructing your psyche but you aren’t your psyche
	- if you don’t get enough praise, change your psyche
	- Have to fight to keep it together
- if you let it go, no more struggle just peace
	- No conveys no beliefs, just moment after moment 
	- events that happen have nothing to do with you,
- if something happens that doesn’t fit your model notice you are just disturbed cuz your model is wrong, don’t do it 
- Any time mind is disturbed, notice and let go
	- Who is aware of darkness? Just go there and let go
## Part V living life
### Chapter 15 path of unconditional happiness
- the highest spiritual path is life itself,
	- **you really only have one choice, do you want to be happy?** 
		- do you want to be happy regardless of what happens? And mean it, cuz you want to qualify it 
- **“the purpose of your life is to enjoy and learn from your experiences, you were not put on earth to suffer. You aren’t helping anyone by being miserable”**
	- Just be happy being alive, if you are committed nothing can stop you
	- if your locked innocently, have fun cuz why not
	- just don’t close your heart, when you want to ask if you will give up your happiness
		- meditate to remember
- Unconditional happiness solves everything
	- will lead beyond happiness to bliss, liberation, nirvana
### Chapter 16 spiritual path of nonresistance 
- spiritual highest path is learning to live life without stress or problems
	- Accept life no resistance, live in state of peace
- Self has will that can resist
	- resisting past is resisting yourself, will only disturb you
	- You have a criteria of what you resist, some past events that left impression
		- You buy into them and think they have meaning, but they just destroy your life
- Watch voice that tells you to resist And Let energy through you
	- deal with acceptance without resistance
	- don’t think you don’t deal with them, since there often is nothing to deal with 
- “imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place”
	- No stress or burnout, so much capacity
	- “If you live like this you can do anything”
- relationships are great way to get to know yourself, don’t judge or resist people
- key is just relax and release energy
### Chapter 17 contemplating death
- “no person or situation can ever teach you as much as death”
	- Death shows you aren’t your body, we are all equal, things we cling to taken away
		- we can learn this at any moment
- A wise being embraces and contemplates the inevitability of death 
	- Live from the deepest part
	- Especially with loved ones you would want them to be happy when your gone, grudges don’t matter if it’s the last time, live like that all the time
- what would do with your last week? 
- **“What are you doing with life” that is what life asks you**
	- Imagine if death comes and says you will die next week, will you say no give me one more week you had so many weeks, and what did you do
- best will live their life fully and no different if they were dying next week, live life with awareness you are very close to death
	- be present without being afraid of next moment, that’s what people that face my death do
- events aren’t important, but a small part of life
	- you might think you would go for special experiences but if you live trying to get something special then you are living it wrong, appreciate your slice
- Death gives meaning to life because makes moment scarce
- death is landlord you are tenant, like sayings lease on life or borrowed time, don’t have fear relationship
### 18 the secret of the middle way
- dao de chi, the dao, the ying and yang, 
- you can read it and not understand anything as it can only be talked around
- The dao is best approached by rhetorical questions 
	- If it good to eat sometimes? Is it good to eat all the time? The dao is inbetween, ying and Yang extremes
	- if you want to spend all your time with someone? You are probably too lonely, pendulum swung too far so your hungry 
- between two extremes is peace and pendulum can stay at rest forever 
	- Harmony of all balance is dao and needs equilibrium through time and space
	- takes all energy to do extremes to spend all time together or have no relationship and feel lonely so strive for relationship
		- just let extremes go, stop putting energy in extremes, and you will be centered 
- in dao easy to see what’s happening, you are present like eye of hurricane. On extremes life seems confusing cuz your confused
	- if you have no preference but seek balance
- “Effortless action is what happens when you come in the dao”
	- You don’t see where you are going, you can only be there with it
### Chapter 19 the loving eyes of god
- there is a connection to divine within us all
	- Direct experience not philosophy
	- **can know god by looking at your transforming self** 
- Overtime you will drift farther away from anxiety cloud and spirit will drift up
	- Feel more spaciousness, distances from you and thoughts
- backdrop is love, openness, it’s spirit naturally
- Nothing in sense that can be higher than what they experience until one day they aren’t there like drop fading into larger ocean and that’s it 
	- One merge into god
- botanical garden is just beautiful but not judging how leaves are and size and direction but it’s everywhere and that’s what’s beautiful
	- God not judging but loving
	- Your eyes could never look without that much love, it’s god looking through you, divine transcendental love
- You can’t know god propositionally, experience it
- Jesus prodigal son had been lost even though he squandered wealth, because now he was found. Love and compassion so deep
- ecstasy is only thing god knows, you can experience it
	- “If god is in ecstasy, I wonder what he sees when he looks at you”

## Review 4/5
I literally feel power by deciding to be open, loving, and present with world.  It has a tinge of too much for me, a little to disconnected from practice or suffering or real difficulty. But the simplicity and hope offers something.good metaphors and pretty decent writing. It has a kind of book that you engage with and enact rather then understand propositinally. Just be happy, let things go, and be present. But tries to point to howwww.

I read this over several months one chapter at a time and regularly found the themes to be universally valuable and profound for whatever problems I was facing. This is the kind of book that is less meant to understand propositionally, but more meant to be emotionally engaged with. I literally feel power and invigorated by deciding to be open, loving, and present. Just let go! But overall, it felt a little too disconnected from practice or suffering to feel like a complete worldview. However, the simplicity of ideas and thoughtful metaphors make this a pleasant, easy spiritual read.
