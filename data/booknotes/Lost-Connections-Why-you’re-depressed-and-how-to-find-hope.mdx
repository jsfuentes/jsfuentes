---

#Book by [[Johann Hari]]

Hottest Takes:
- No evidence seroton affects mood it was marketing copy
- Fat people do it as a defense


Prologue
- He begged the doctor to make it stop. "the doctor says you need your nausea. It is a message, and we must listen to the message "
Intro 
- (Antidepressement will become the sons of brave new world)
- Age of Prozac 1990, some people just have less serotonin and we just need to fix it
	- Doctor didn't ask if there was any reason you feel distressed, anything to change. Like asking a dementia patent why they don't know where they left their keys it's not their fault it's biology 
	- author loved realization he had depression and there was a solution
		- He got on it and felt positive effect instantly thought it should have taken 2 weeks
		- Put on weight and would sweat but with price it s as he kept increasing dosage
	- alternative explanation was parents had it so also genetic
- (Everything I want to write is depressing, so I don't want to write it, Dmitri said he was depressed)
- But puzzles
	- 1. Why was he still sad?
		- therapist suggested he was still depressed but that didn't make sense cuz he was taking the drugs now
		- Sadness would always outrun dosage
	- 2. Why are so many more people taking it and apparently feeling depressed? What changed/
		- 1 in 5 adults take psychiatric drug
		- Water supply is laced with antidepressants
	- Water supply even has antidepressants
			- (Looked it up trace amounts, one study said if you drink 2L a day for 70 years you would take 1% of dose, but we don't know what chronic exposure does and it has been show to have affects in animals...)
	- 3. Could something other than brain chemistry be causing depression?
- Anxiety and depression were considered different things, panic attacks and sadness but they "arent that distinct" says Robert Kohlenberg a psychology professor
- Unhappiness is totally different than depression as being depressed and told to jolly up or do X is infurating
	- but forces that make us depressed/anxious makes us unhappy, they are connected
- The rising depression/anxiety is "largely in the world, and the way we are living in it" with 9 proven causes
- Two large stories that were lies
	- 1 is was a personal embarrassment and weakness
	- 2 it was a malfunctioning brain
## Part One - The Crack in The Old Story
Chapter 1 The Wand
- Company would use a mysteries tractor, a metal rod, to draw the sickness out of people especially with chronic pain and it worked
	- Doctor John Jaygarth replicated it by on 5 patients by running a random stick of metal over their body and tell them of its magically effects similar to company and found it worked on 3 though for some effect didn't last
- The Emperor's New Drug Placebo?
	- Placebo drug experiments often don't include control group not given anything, but important to see if people get better themselves for efficiacy
	- Efficacy of Antidepressants due to 25% natural recovery, 50% story, 25% chemicals
	- Studies from FDA drug studies show real effect of drug **is almost no meaningful effect** 
			- on 0-51 scale of depression only worth 1.8 points, a third of getting better sleep, after publishing scientists revealed it was a "dirty little secret" 
			- side effects are real including weigh, sexual dsyfunction, or start to sweat a lot
			- Paxil, 3 studies by manufacturer: placebo worked better, no effect, and mixed results yet company announced it worked with partial publication
		- Lancet studied top 14 antidepressants given to teenagers and showed that they didn't work with one minor exception
Chapter 2 Imbalance
- Why do we think depression comes from imbalance of serotin?
	- One drug made people euphoric for a short time and doctors went out on limb and was like maybe its increasing serotin implying lack of serotin causes depression
	- **No evidence serotonin levels affect mood**, "it has come as close to being proven wrong, he told me, as you ever get in science"
		- Study in 1970s lowered serotonin levels and it didnt affect mood at all
		- It was marketing copy, professor says "There wasn't ever any evidence for it" and 50% of field never believed it
		- Anti depressant drugs both increase and decrease serotonin levels
- How did this scam become so popular don't we have the FDA?
	- FDA salaries mostly pa
	- id by drug companies and company runs and writes the studies
	- All you have to do is produce two trials anytime anywhere in the world that suggest some positive effects with any number of trials so 998 is fine
- Why break the spell, placebos work right?
	- "We know that SSRIs in particular contribute to sexual dysfunction, and the rates for most SSRIs are around 75 percent of treatment-engendered sexual dysfunction" ^987315
	- Antidepressents actually increase risk of sucide and violent criminal behavior in young people, risk of death in older people, diabetes, in pregnant women it increases the risk of miscarriage, autism, and deformity
	- 20% experience withdrawal 
- Peter staked his career on antidepressants so argued back
	- maybe it only worked for major depression(nope) 
	- maybe it needed more time(nope)
	- okok last argument studies only can pay 40-80 and study someone with only depression nothing else and so give care like therapy and community to poor people and poor give whatever answer they think researcher wants to hear so they can be a part of it even if they dont have condition
		- IE antidepressants work because all scientific evidence for it is fraudulent, powerfully proven but...
	- Even Peter argues only doing antidepresseants for 6-20 weeks
- Study of changing dosage and different medicines and found it did work, 67% feel better but "within a year, half of the patients were fully depressed again" 1/3 recovered but natural recovery is part of this
	- 65-80% of people on antidepressants continue to be depressed
	- Standard experience is cycling through different medications and dosage for effects
The Grief Exception
- "Giving a person a story about why they feel their pain is one of the most powerful things you can do"
- grieving matches depression symptoms
	- trauma psychologist noticed many people losing family in traumatic circumstances diagnosis with depression and given meds, 
	- so if you recently lost someone(1 year slashed to 2 weeks) lets just say its not depression
		- but if you say depression is normal sometimes then is death the only event?? Arent you acknowledge circumstances are important
- We grieve because we love
- What if depression is a form of grief for our own lives not being as they should be? What if it is a form of grief for the connections we have lost, yet still need?
The first flag on the moon
	- 1970s study with deep interviews following women diagonsised with depression both reactive(environment) and endogenous(biological) depression
		- Found severe life events and long term stressors like poor marriage or no friends were highly correlated to depression with 68% of depressed experiencing one compared to 20% of nondepressed
		- Found poverty didnt cause depression, just more severe life events/stressors
		- Combine severe life events with long term stressors then 75% chance of depression, compounds when combined 
		- **biological depression just caused by some random imbalance didn't seem to exist**
	- Depression is a generalization of hopelessness that spreads over your entire life
	- Psychatrity now says biologial, social, and psychological factors of depression, but for some you just learn its an imbalance not about environment\
## p2 disconnection: 9 causes of depression and anxiety
Picking Up the Flag - P2 intro
- all the causes are forms of disconnection
1 - Disconnection from Meaningful Work
- Monotonous, dead end job giving paint with no clear way to improve, make his voice heard, or be challenged so turned to Oxycotin
	- Told he was born an addict, but he had not become addicted to drugs before 
**- 87% of people dont enjoy their job**
	- Gallup study acrosss countries says 13% of people engaged at their job, enthusiastic/committed to their work, 63% not engaged so putting time not energy or passion, 24% actively disengaged just unhappy and undermine engaged
	- 80% of brits think phone call out of work hours acceptable
- "derealization", feeling that nothing you are doing is authentic or real
- The worst job stress isn't responsibility but work that is monotonous and boring. People att to less likely to be drained and more likely to have more friends
	- Study of government workers in England and how type of work affects health and happiness
		- You would think higher means more stressful, but found that people at the top of the hierarchy were 4 times less likely to have a heart attack
		- "If you worked in the civil service and you had a higher degree of control over your work, you were a lot less likely to become depressed or develop severe emotional distress than people working at the same pay level, with the same status, in the same office, as people with a lower degree of control over their work"
		- The higher up you go the more friends and social activity you have after work as low status jobs just want to collapse as job shatters them
- difference between good job and bad job, efforts and rewards
	- Tax inspectors kept killings themselves because never ending work despite their best effort and no one cares
- Joe works deadend job instead of being a fishing guide because there's a part of all of us that thinks if I keep buying more stuff people will think I'm doing good so I'll be happy

	- 3 times more likely to get sick and everything became more fatal
	- Same health effect as being obese
- Lonely people are anxious, have low self esteem, pessimistic, and are afraid other people will dislike them. 
- Loneliness causes depression
	- hypothesis people to either remember feeling alone or connected and they become more much depressed or less. Study was to see how feeling lonely affected depression without changing anything else in their lives
	- Study of normal people waiting for them to develop depression as people do found loneliness preceded depression
		**- On 1 to 100 loneliness scale, going from 50-65 made you 8x more likely to develop depression**
- human evolved for tribes and to get back to the group
	- Loneliness linked to micro awakenings where you don't remember but wake up probably evolved because you don't feel safe as you aren't safe 
	- Hutterites of Amish with strong cooperation according to micro awakening had lowest level of loneliness researchers seen in the world

Conclusion: Homecoming
- What do you tell himself when he first started antidepressants as a teenager?
	- "You aren't a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being met. You need to have a community. You need to have meaningful values, not the junk values you've been pumped full of all your life, telling your happiness comes through money and buying objects. You need to have meaningful work. You need the natural world. You need to feel you are respected. You need a secure future. You need connection to ask these things. You need to release any shame you might feel for having been mistreated"
	- Is not your brain, is your pain. Your distress is a signal and ally leading you away from a wasting life
- We lost faith in anything bigger or more meaningful than the individual
- "There's no such thing as society, only individuals and their family" - thatcher
- depression and grief have identical symptoms, depression is a form of grief for all the connections we need but don't have
- Solution isn't just individual changes, should be collective solution as it's a collective problem
- Instead of thinking of your village as your home, people think of just their house
