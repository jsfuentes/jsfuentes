#Book by [[Benjamin Graham]]
- Investing is reliable, speculating isnt. 
	- Never mingle the money between the two. 
- When it's rising it could crash, when its a crashing it could rise.
- Must limit investment amount hard. 
- Invest in what you know, but don't become lazy just cuz it's familiar. 
- Enron invested in themselves. 
- Knowledge about an industry or company could just be the illusion of knowledge. 
- If you wanna be a aggressive investor, you need to devote a significant amount of time and energy because you need to beat people and machines whose JOB it is to trade. 
- Defensive investors can say Idk and I don't care to every wuestion though. 
- Bond 25-75% 
- And stock 25-75. 
- Most reliable successful companies mean most speculative stocks. 
- Never buy something because it is going up or sell because it is going down. 
- Never buy a stock immediately after substantial drop or rise.
- Whatever you invest in will have fluctuations, be above it. 
- People have a tendency to predict long term success based on short term success for example in our lives hard work and skill are rewarded, a good kid constantly reaps benefits, investments are luck tho....
