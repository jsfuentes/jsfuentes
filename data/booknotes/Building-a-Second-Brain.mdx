- This system will
  - Find anything your learned or touched in seconds

## Part One The Foundation understanding what's possible

### Chapter 1 where it all started

**- "Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them"**

- Author had bizarre unknown medical condition where he had pain in back of throat
  - After no doctor could help, decided to become his own project manager and collected all his info
  - Experimented and found plan of diet and exercises
  - Quantified Self Movement
  - Inspired in him value of searchable digital notes
- His second brain becomes huge asset as a consultant of that one fact or file
- This book isn't self improvement, it's making something outside yourself to leave you wondering and wandering

### 2 what is a second brain

- We consume 34GB a day and 26% of knowledge worker day is spent looking for and consolidating info
- Remembering give us less time for creativity
- Leonardo had commonplace book where he would record thoughts and carry it with him
- Modern media cares about novel and public, but we should aim for timeless and private
- Digitial Commonplace Book
  - Study notebook, personal journal, and sketchbook for new ideas
  - Calendar is extension of brain remembering
- Note is knowledge building block
  - In school learn knowledge is for test the disposable, but professional is different
    - It is not clear what you should take notes on
    - Unclear when you will need it or why
    - Can reference anytime
    - Actions and creating more than just recall
  - Note if anything interpreted through your lens, curated and stored from image, thoughts, or passage
  - Can be built into newer works like building blocks
- With second brain, the way your mind works changes and you start to be better able to record and interact with your thoughts

### 3 how a second brain works

- Second brain like personal assistant with following tasks:
  - Making our ideas concrete
    - see and move around ideas to offload complexity
  - Revealing new associations
    - Creative people better at recognizing relationships making associations and connections
  - Incubating ideas over time
    - We often require heavy lifts of only our current ideas when we face problem. Recency bias means we think about the most recent ideas mostly.
    - Permanent storage means long term ideas simmer
  - Sharpening our unique perspectives
    - Jobs mostly likely to stick around are those involving a unique perspective
    - Advocating for particular point of view
- Choosing a note taking app
  - Digital not apps are multimedia, informal/easy to use, flexible
  - digital lets you search shares link and sync
  - Check out buildingasecondbrain.com/resources
- Three stages of knowledge managing
  - remember, store things you want to remember
  - connect, goes from memory to thinking device as old ideas help with new thoughts and problems
  - Creating, seeing so much knowledge on topic they decide to share it by creating
- Code: capture, organize, distill, express
  - Capture what resonates
    - So much stuff, we must be curator
    - When something resonates, moves you intuitively as most interesting useful or surprising
    - Can detect what inspires us and learn more about ourselves by seeing what resonates
  - Organize, save for actionability
    - best to consider new info in terms of utility
    - Utility focus gives you clear filter for what to record to
  - Distill find the essence
    - write main takeaways
    - Always ask yourself how you can make note ideal for future you
    - Explain what caught your attention about article
  - Express, show your work
    - Information should be used
    - shift as much of your time from consuming to creating
    - Evaluate, share, tech, record, post, and lobb

## Part 2: The Method: 4 Steps of CODE

### 4 Capture - Keep what Resonates

- Taylor swifts writes notes on her phone to make songs
  - Blank space was just her best notes from the last several years that hit her at random times
  - "I kind of have to capitalize on the excitement of me getting that idea and see it all the way through or else I'll leave it behind and assume it wasn't good enough"
- Songwriters have hook books, coders have code libraries, lawyers keep case files, marketers keep swipe files with examples of compelling ads
- How to decide what to save if we don't know what future holds?
- Knowledge = Content
  - Outer content: Highlights, Quotes, Bookmarks/links, voice memos, meeting notes, images, takeaways/notes
  - Inner content: Stories (favorite anecdotes), insights, memories, reflections, musings
- What Not to Keep
  - Sensitive info because should be easily available to you(I disagree its whatever)
  - Special file format like photoshop or video files
  - Large file hurt note taking app performance
  - Collaboratively edited file?
- Feynman quotes
  - "You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly in your mind"
  - "It doesn't have any importance... I don't care whether a thing has importance. Isn't it fun?"
- Make list of open ended questions
  - How can you make the more enjoyable parts of teaching the main parts?
  - How should you approach relationships with people when there is tension between honesty and status signaling?
  - How will the shift virtually change education?
  - What is the highest leverage thing to change the education system?
  - How should I motivate myself to succeed?
- Capture Criteria (Capture What Resonates)
  - Capture based on your important questions
  - Great article, do you capture all of it?
    - No, "the value is not evenly distributed" only get the best parts (&lt;10%)
    - Curators should be picky, more picky means less overwhelm and work for future self
  - 4 Questions
    - Does it Inspire Me? Is it Useful? Is it Personal? Is it Surprising?
  - emotions organize rather than disrupt rational thinking, resonating emotion is intuitive mind telling us something
  - "I can't think of anything more important for you creative life-and your life in genral- than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside"
- Beyond Your Notetaking App: Choosing Capture Tools
  - Ebook Highlighting, read later to bookmark content, basic notes for capturing short text, pulling content from social media, web clippers to save parts of pages, audio/voice transcription
  - Make sure to combine in your notes app
  - Can capture from Youtube Video Transcripts(three dots => show transcript)
- The Surprising Benefits of Externalizing our Thoughts
  - Writing down helps you remember and think
  - Writing about internal experience found to improve wellbeing

### 5 Organize -save for actionability

- Twyla Tharp famous choreographer uses "the box" method to organize
  - Every new project gets a foldable file box and puts everything related there from inspiration to notebooks and recordings
  - Creating box makes sense of commitment
  - Create goal or personal mantra like "keep it simple" or "something perfect" or "economy" to remind her for what she was thinking when she started if she loses her way
  - Box lets you put project on hold and see how it progresses
- The Cathedral Effect:Designing a Space for your ideas it's important so you know where to go when it's time to create
- Organizing for action: where 99% of note takers get stuck and how to solve it
  - The problem with organizing by date, subject, type etc is they are not integrated into my daily life
  - I often resorted to get dropping everything in my current project so at least I could do my current work
- PARA organizes info based on how actionable it is
  - use this organization system everywhere you organize info
  - Projects
    - short term specific clear outcomes that you are working on now and will end
    - EG Finish Spanish Course, develop project plan, publish blog post
  - Area
    - Long term responsibilities you want to manage over time
    - Activities or places you are responsible for, people you responsible for our accountable to, and standards of performance you are responsible for
    - Eg cooking, finances, spouse, marketing, manager, hiring
  - Resources
    - Things I want to reference in the future like stock photos, note taking, anime
  - archive
    - Completed projects, areas that don't matter anymore like old relationships, or hobbies you don't care about anymore
- Add prefixes to work stuff to keep it together
- Where to save
  - "The moment you first capture an idea is the worst tone to try to decide what it relates to" because increase friction
  - Decide if info goes in projects if not consider areas if not consider resources if not place in archives
    - put not where it is most useful but where it is most useful the soonest
  - Notice we don't keep all our books or quotes together
  - Your needs change do you could move a note from projects to resources and back
  - Don't organize just move it to Archive until you need it
  - Project completion is life blood of system, just move it to archive, then when you start new project pull in resources from archive
  -

### 6 Distill find the essence

- create notes as content you are sending into the future for your busy self
- Do progressive summarization
  - bold passages then highlight most essential bolder passages then write summary of you reference note often
  - Can do bolding/summarizing at later time when your low energy or when you actually use it
- Think about our personal note design as we do website design, for best user experience
- Mistakes:
  - over highlighting- Notes shouldn't be text but more like bookmarks
  - highlighting without purpose- everytimr you touch not leave it better
  - Have too high bar for highlighting

### 7 Express show your work

- life is too short not to save all your intermediate packets(up) when producing something
- IP lets you start a new project without a blank slate
  - distilled notes, ideas that didn't make final project, past project drafts/plans, past projects, documents created by others
- Work in IP, small packets of distilled deliverables
  - Makes you able to handle interruption
  - Make progress in short spans of time
  - allow you to collect more feedback
  - easily create new ip by combining others
- If your planning a conference, can make list of all deliverables agenda, email to invite speakers, breakout session topics, and find templates examples and add as you come up with ideas
- 4 retrieval methods
  - Search
  - Browsing
  - Tags, can add to notes without moving their folder but have them in one place
  - Serendipity
- Can send distilled articles to friends instead of the article
- Only start projects that are 80% done
- Ask for feedback early
- "We only know what we make"
  - The feedback you receive is more valuable than anything
  - "what is important is finding your voice and insisting that what you say matters"
  - Prove to yourself that your ideas can make a difference

## Part 3 Making Things Happen

### 8 the art of creative execution

- Creative output changes rapidly from TikTok to novels, but process is unchanging
  - Process alternates between divergence considering many options to convergence where you decide what is essential
    - convergence mode you should close the door put headphones on and ignore new input and sprint toward your goal
    - Divergence mode you should open up your horizons and explore every possible option
      **- The more curious, diverse your interess and higher your standards the more you struggle with convergence**
- "we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something"
- "By the time you sit down to make progress on something, all the work to gather and organize the source material needs to be already done"
- Three strategies to avoid pitfalls of convergence
  - Give yourself stepping stones
    - Create many ideas and sources first, then just connect to avoid blank page
    - Separate choosing which ideas you want from arranging the ideas
  - use yesterdays momentum today
    - Hemingway would only end a writing session when he knew what came next
    - At end of writing session, write down next steps/current status/mental details/intentions or send off your draft for feedback
  - reduce the scope like a PM
    - postpone/cut least important parts and save in second brain
    - Think of a release as something you are getting feedback on and can correct later
- Steps: pick a project, make an outline of goals and intentions and questions, find stuff from second brain, and then make a first pass just using your current knowledge to make something like a plan and rough draft etc

### 9 the essential habits of digital organizers

- Keep workspace clean in the flow of using it and externalize thinking in tbe environment
- Three essential habits
  - Project checklists to ensure you start and finish projects consistently
    - You should be recycling knowledge to make sure it can be used in the future
    - Kickoff checklist, 5 steps 30 min
      - Capture current thinking and resources/people to explore
      - Review second brain for relevant notes(don't go on tangents)
      - Search for related terms
      - Move notes to folder
      - Create an outline of notes and plan project
    - project completion 10/15 minutes
      - Mark project as complete in task management
      - review intermediate packets and move them to other folders
      - Move project to archives
  - Weekly and Monthly Reviews
    - weekly habit to reset and review work and life writing down to do, active projects, and decide priorities
  - Noticing Habits
    - noticing when you have or see an idea or reorganizing your notes

### 10 The Path of Self Expression

- Mindset > Toolset
  - You take in information with a certain, default attitude, lens of which you study and career goals
- We think we need to know more, but we don't
- The Fear our minds cant do enough
  - mistakes and doubts are just info to process
  - your mind can be calmer knowing you have this second brain
- Giving your first brain a new job, CEO of your life to turn info to results not remembering
- Shifting from info scarcity to info abundance, more isnt better
  - the seeds we need most find us, just listen it comes multiple times
- Shift from obligation or pressure to spirit of service, people want to teach and mentor
  - Knowledge spread is more valuable because you become in sync with others
- Shift from consuming to creating ^3dde81
  - Resonating reflects something within you
  - We can't explain how we know what we know, tacit knowledge see patterns
  - "You search outside of yourself to search within yourself, knowing that everything you find has always been a part of you" #quote ^927a85
- Author hit low point because of neck pain
  - Vipassana Meditation, writing in public
