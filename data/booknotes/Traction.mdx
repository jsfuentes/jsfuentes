SEO and Viral Marketing is when you current customers bring new ones

Duckduckgo went for new search engine, and made a widget that linked back to duckduckgo

Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand, cunsomuer software can be hundreds of thousands and Enterprise can be a few

Traction is growth which pg

2 main themes:

Most founders often limit themselves to channels they know or work in industry

- most underused for an industry may be best

Hard to tell what channels will work

Traction method is called bullseye and revolves around quick tests and then Joni on those that work

19 channels of growth

Blog targeting, publicity, unconvential PR(publicity stunt or eztreme service), search engine marketing which is ads on search, social or display ads, offline ads (commericals, print), SEO(show up for search results), content marketing, email marketing, engineering as marketing (widgets, side projects), viral marketing (referrals), business development (strategic relationship), sales, affiliate programs, existing platforms, trade shows, offline events sponsorship, speaking, community building

Traction thinking

Common story is entrepreneurs have a product, but work on that instead of everything else.

50% of time on traction, 50% on product

Pursuing in parallel gives you cold customers that let you get an even better idea of what people want. Slows down product development in short run, but you often need more cycles when product hits markets as well. It will be a leaky bucket but that's fine

Set traction goal

3 phases: make a product people want, market something people want, scale

Do things that don't scale

Viral and community scale with size of community, need to change what you do as you have new growth numbers

Founders often to early, and often choose their idea to quickly

Bullseye

Distribution is biggest reason for failure

Great to get at least one channel to work, most get 0 and run multiple workout thinking of what is best

Know history of your industry and marketing that worked and that didn't

Want to determine channels that might be able to scale, small tests with &lt;1k and a month

Solely focus on channel that works after tests

One channel usually dominates some point of growth, and other channels might support it

Bullseye let's you try other channel, and soon in on the one that works and moved the needle

When channel stops moving needle, switch and redo when it stops working

Similar to lean

If you build it they will come, is wrong

Easiest way to research industry is to talk to who founders who failed

Testing

Channel strategies within a channel like print out billboards for offline ads

Cost, number available, are the customers the ones you want right now

Outer ring, to middle ring, to inner ring

Middle, Less optimization and more cheap channel test

Inner ring is optimizing

A/B Test to scientifically test change of variable like signups. Optimize ly, unbounce make it easy

Over time all marketing channels become saturated, ignored by customers or more costly. Solution is to find the next marketing strategy. Banner ads once had 70 click through. Zynga dominated Facebook channel

Track on spreadsheet, CAC, LTV, number of customers be quantitative even if guesses

Critical path

Choose what to focus on based on your traction goal for company significane

Path to hit traction goal is critical path, constantly evaluate with relation to goal, and put on calendar

Founders often ignore promising channels due to inherent biases, can almost be competitive advantage though

Every channel listed has been used as main one for both consumer and Enterprise businesses

Targeting blogs

Most effective for first wave of customers
