Sometimes loving ourselves can be really hard. Instead of self-love, we often get trapped in cycles of self-criticism and self-doubt. But, we must practice self-acceptance, self-compassion, and self-understanding.

> There is no “flaw” or “darkness” — your anxieties, insecurities, doubts, disgust, disappointment, envy — etc. None of it is “bad.” It merely is.

Despite any imperfections, we are all worthy of love and compassion. We must accept our real selves without criticism or judgment.

Amazing [new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techniques_of_neutralization) [research](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6f9/6396e11d17951df4b1d1b11a5444e948c46e.pdf) describes 5 ways to overcome our internal criticisms and recognize ourselves as the beautiful, good people we are!

In response to any self-criticism or criticism, just consider if:

## 1. You are subject to circumstance

Sometimes events are beyond your control. Circumstance takes you by the hand into a losing situation.

## 2. It doesn’t matter

Whatever part of yourself that is being criticized is not important. It doesn’t cause any real harm or damage to yourself and others.

## 3. You are a good person

In your past, there are good things you have done. It can be hard to see, but you possess some admirable character traits. Even if the criticism is true, you are a good person and always will be.

## 4. You are a victim

In this world, you have suffered, lost, and constantly faced adversity. Some person or group is harassing and oppressing you which pushes you to do bad things and criticize yourself. But it is not your fault.

## 5. The criticism is warranted

I don’t know what this is doing here. You can just ignore this one, my bad.
