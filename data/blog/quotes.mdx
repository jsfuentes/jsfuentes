You, enlightened, self-sufficient, self-governed, endowed with gifts above your fellows, the world expects you to produce as well as to consume, to add to and not to subtract from its store of good, to build up and not tear down, to ennoble and not degrade. It commands you to take your place and to fight your fight in the name of honor and of chivalry, against the powers of organized evil and of commercialized vice, against the poverty, disease, and death which follow fast in the wake of sin and ignorance, against all the innumerable forces which are working to destroy the image of God in man, and unleash the passions of the beast. There comes to you from many quarters, from many voices, the call of your kind. It is the human cry of spirits in bondage, of souls in despair, of lives debased and doomed. It is the call of man to his brother … such is your vocation; follow the voice that calls you in the name of God and of man. The time is short, the opportunity is great; therefore, crowd the hours with the best that is in you ~ Hibben’s address to Yale graduates 1913

Find full reward
Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be
Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.
And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts
Thy piety, casting all self aside,

Abandoning desires which shake the mind--
Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul,
He hath attained the Yog--that man is such!
In sorrows not dejected, and in joys
Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress
Of passion, fear, and anger;

If one
Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs
Attraction; from attraction grows desire,
Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds
Recklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--
Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,
Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.
~ BHAGAVAD Gita

He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion… Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations.

Play long-term games with long-term people.

All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Avoid competition through authenticity

Work with people with high intelligence, high energy, and high integrity

People are oddly consistent, you want irrationally ethical

Action bias: either lead, follow, or get out of the way

Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage

There is no skill called business, learn psychology, economics, computers, game theory

Reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching

Read what you love until you love to read

Means of knowledge is abundant, desire to learn is scarce.

Leverage is force multiplier for judgement.

Wisdom is judgment on a personal level and knowing long term actions.

Investing requires broad base judgement. Study philosophy and make better decisions.

Be patient with results and impatient with actions.

Avoid people who gained success quickly they are just giving you winning lottery numbers

When you finally are rich, you will realize it wasnt what you wanted in the first place

A calm mind a fit body and a house full of love, these things can't be bought they must be earned

Inspiration is perishable. Seize motivation

The soul of the individual eternally hungers for the heroism of genuine being, and willingness to take on that responsibility is identical to the decision to live a meaningful life.

The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it’s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it’s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it’s indifference. ~ Elie Wiesel

It is the line that forms on the right. It is the don’t in don’t shove. It is the hole in the stuffed shirt through which the sawdust slowly trickles; it is the dent in the high hat. Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time. It is the feeling of privacy in the voting booths, the feeling of communion in the libraries, the feeling of vitality everywhere. Democracy is a letter to the editor. Democracy is the score at the beginning of the ninth. It is an idea which hasn’t been disproved yet, a song the words of which have not gone bad. It’s the mustard on the hot dog and the cream in the rationed coffee. Democracy is a request from a War Board, in the middle of a morning in the middle of a war, wanting to know what democracy is. ~ E.B White

## Insanity

I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. ~ Edgar Allan Poe

Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. ~ Rob Siltanen

Pain is the foundation for growth but when it is all the same you need a psychologist ~ Dr Frost.
